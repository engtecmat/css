<h1>CSS Transformation Animation</h1>
<p>
    All right, finally we have sorted things out. Good morning everyone. So my name is Sapna and Sally Jo is on leave today, so I'm covering for her. So today's topic is CSS, transition, transforms and animations, and I'm suppose that you already know what CSS is and you have already started with your project and working with the CSS. So we will learn more about CSS today. Very simple topic. So first of all, transformation. So in a normal English language, what we say is when we say transform, so that means we want to change the thing in its form or appearance or structure. right, So that's a normal dictionary definition. but as per MDN, Mozilla developer network definition. So CSS transform property lets you modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. Using it, elements can be translated, it can be rotated, it can be scaled, it can be skewed according to the value set that you provide in the CSS property. So we will look at the syntax of transformation. So normally in the CSS, like you define any other property, it's very similar. You define the transform property, So transform colon and the value and then end with the semicolon: okay, So if you want no transformation, so that means we will say transform colon, none. If we want some kind of transformation to be done on that particular div or any other element. So you will say transform colon, and then you define the transform function and again end with the semicolon. If you want to provide more than one transform function, we can also do that and the syntax is this. So you just apply different transform functions in one single line of code. So transform colon, transform function, transform function and another transform function. It always apply it in a sequence, So the first one written, will be applied first, and then the second one and the third one and then so on. Now what are the different transformation functions in CSS? So these are the different transformation functions: Translate, rotate scale, x, scale, y or simply scale, where you provide x and y coordinates. Similarly, we have got a skew, so you can skew it by x axis or y axis or you can provide x and y axis both using skew and metrics. So these are the different transform functions that can be applied. So we will look at those ones. So the first one is rotate. Now, if you want your div image or any other element to be rotated right in its clockwise position from its where it is currently lying, so you need to have the rotate function. So counterclockwise rotation can be achieved by using negative values. So if you want to have it anticlockwise, then you use negative values. If you want to do it clockwise, then it will be the positive values. So the syntax is transform and then you apply the rotate function, So rotate, and you have to provide the angle, by which angle you want to rotate that particular element of the HTML, Whether it is by 5 degrees or minus 5 degrees if it is anticlockwise. So this is an example. So this is being taken from w3schoolscom. the link is provided here. So what we have got in here is we have got the normal HTML tag. then, as usual, you write the head tag and now we have got some styling here. So we have got a div. So we have got a div right. So this is a div that you are looking at. Its width is 300 pixel, height is 100 pixels, background color is yellow and the border is 1 pixel, solid black. So that's how this normal div is displayed, right, And what you have written in this in the body. So you have got the heading, the rotate method, and then you have got a paragraph. We have got a paragraph which is writing: the method rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise, and then we have got a div in which there is a text written. this is a normal div element, right. Now what we want is we want this div to be rotated by 20 degrees. So what we have got is div: hash my div. So all of you know, hash my div. So that means we are accessing that particular div with its ID right, Because we have given the ID my div to this particular div. Now, on this div, we are providing the rotate function. So we are writing transform, So we are writing transform colon: rotate it by 20 degrees. So it will rotate it 20 degrees clockwise, okay. And similarly, you can apply different angles, right, So we can have a look at this, right. So this is. these are the examples, I think, in the slide which are taken from the W3 school, Quite easy to understand and you can play around with those. So, for example, you want to have it by 40 degrees, Okay, And if you run it, you see it is done Rotated. And if you want to do it anti-clockwise, So you can have it minus 40 and you will see that it is rotated anti-clockwise. Now this rotate function can be applied on any element of the HTML that you want. Now, depending upon, are you doing the book project? Yes, So, depending upon what type of book you have chosen, it will have different elements. It will have different paragraphs or different things that you want to highlight, or you know any book watermark you want to do it, or anything, depending upon what type of book you have chosen. So you can apply a rotate function on the elements of that book, Usually like if you want to have a watermark, So you always see that on a paper the watermark is usually in a diagonal, So you can have that watermark in the using this rotate function. Okay, So back to our slides. So that was a rotate. Now next is scale. So scale means you want to scale the element relative to its original size. Again, you have to specify a value within the scale transform function, which are unit less and should be thought of as a multiplier. Okay, So we will have a look at the example and the syntax. So you can either scale it by x-axis or scale it by y-axis, or you can use a simple scale function where you provide the value of the x as well as the value of y. So if you want to scale it, x and y-axis. so this is the syntax. So you use the transform property of CSS and then the scale function and you have to provide the the x value of x-axis. So you have to use the value of x-axis. So you have to use a particular scale x function and then provide the value of x-axis so that it doesn't even. you know if you're using scale and if you're just providing one value, so it will assume that both x and y are same. But if you do not want to be scaled, but if you do not want to be scaled at both x and y, so you make sure that you are using only scale x and scale y function, Okay. So scale x and provide the value of x-axis and scale y and then you have to provide the value of the y. So this is the example again, like we have got a div, Okay. So you normally start your HTML file with HTML tag head and then we have got the styling here. This is the styling for this particular div, with the margin, 150 pixels width and height, and the background color is yellow again and we have got the border one pixel, solid black. And now in that this document, we have got the heading again, the scale method, a paragraph that the scale method increases or decreases the size of an element. and then we have got this div. Okay, Now for this div, we are providing a transform function, a transform property, and we are scaling it 2 comma 3.. So that means it will be bigger from its normal size: 2 on the x-axis and 3 on the y-axis. Okay, We can again play around with this. Okay, So this is the div. Let's say we want maybe 5, and here let's say 7.. So you can see it has increased in size. Okay, So let's say zoom in or zoom out, Okay. So again, I think this is quite big. So let's say 2 comma 2.. So it will scale it accordingly. So if you want to have only x-axis, so you have to make sure that you are using scale x and you are providing only one value and when you run it, So you can see, here it will only scale it by x-axis. And similarly, if you want it by y-axis, so you see that it is scaled just by y-axis and on x-axis the size remains normal. Okay, So you can play around with the example. You can play around with what you are doing with your book project and try to apply these transformation functions on it. So we have seen rotating, We have seen scaling, and the next is skew. So skew, it skews that element along x and or y-axis by an angle value. Okay. So again we have seen very similar syntax to what we have seen. So we have got the transform property, skew function, and then you have to provide the angle on the x-axis as well as y-axis. If it is just x-axis, so make sure you are using skew x and you are providing angle x and skew y, angle y. So again we can have a look at an example. So again, a normal document starting. we again have another div with some text written in it. Okay, So here you are using skew x function. Okay, So when you are using skew x on this and you are doing it by 20 degrees, so you can see it is the rectangle shape is now a sort of parallelogram, Okay, So you are skewing it using x-axis. Similarly, similarly, if you just use the y-axis and try to play around so you can see it is skewed by y-axis, Okay. And if you want to have it on both, so you normally use the skew and then 20 degrees so you can see it is skewed in both the directions by using the angles, Okay. So again, it depends upon your project and how you are displaying things on it. So this is the example we have seen. So these are the transform functions. Okay, Now the next one is the translate. So translate is moving an element either vertically or horizontally relative to its current position. Positive values will move the element right on the x-axis or down on the y-axis- Okay, In a normal direction, either x-axis or down in the y-axis. If you are using negative values, then it will move the element on the left-hand side of the x-axis and up on the y-axis, And any regular length value can be used, either pixels or em, etc. So we will have a look at the syntax again. So, again, it is a transform function. So you use the transform property and then the translate function and you provide the value of x and y. And similarly, if you want to translate only by x-axis, so you just use translate x, And if you want to translate it by x-axis, then you choose the translate y and provide the value y. So let's have a look at the example again. So, again a very similar example. It's very, very easy topic and quite straightforward to see. So again, we have got a normal HTML document with the heading, with the paragraph and a div with the particular properties like width, height, background, color, border. And now we are using the translate: 50 pixels and 100 pixels. So it is moving 50 pixels towards the right-hand side and 100 pixels down. Okay, So normally, if you don't use the transform function, okay and run it, so the normal, this div should be here right Now. you are providing the transform function, you are providing the transform property and the translate function And you run it. you see the div is translated from one position to another position, depending on the values that you are providing. So again, if you just want the x-axis, not x and y, So you will see here it will be just moved towards the left-hand side- sorry, right-hand side- towards the x-axis. And if it is only y, so you will see it will go down, but nothing will happen on the x-axis side. And if you provide the negative values, so you can see here it is going upwards in the y-direction. And similarly, if you are having x and it will move towards the left-hand side, Okay, So this is how you can translate the different elements of your HTML. In these examples it is just showing about the div, but it can be applied on any element in your HTML. So the question is, why would you actually translate when you can use more established CSS standards for layout and formatting? right, So you can think of translate as a more efficient way to move placements in a translation or animation. So basically, when you are trying to show some animation, okay, so you can have, you can provide some timer that the div or any image or something like moves, rotates, come and then maybe disappear or maybe come back to its normal position. So you can use normal position. So you can use in that way. okay, but normal CSS can also be applied, but I think you might have to write more lines of codes. But with this you can just use the function and provide the values and it will be translated. So another one is transform origin, So a CSS property that defines the point from which a CSS transform is applied to an element. By default, transform origin is set to the center of an element, which is 50%. So this is the syntax. So transform origin property. and then you provide the X offset and the Y offset. So X offset is basically a length or percentage from the left edge of the elements box And Y is the length or percentage from the top edge of the elements box, And these are the accepted keywords: Left- 0%, center, 50%, right, 100%, 90%, whatever percentage, whatever value you want to provide. Top is 0% and bottom is 100%. So we can have a look at the example. So here you can see we are rotating this relative by trying changing its X-axis and Y-axis. So you are rotating, So you can use the sliders and you can rotate right. And then, similarly, you are rotating it by X-axis or Y-axis. you are doing the transformer region. So transformer region is usually starting by 50%, 50% offset, But again, you can change it. And let's have a look at this code, okay, So what we are doing here. so you are normally starting with your HTML tags, right? So let's have a look at the body first. So in this we have got a novel paragraph that we are rotating the red div element, try changing its X-axis and Y-axis, which is written here: right, Let's open here, right. And then we have got the div right With the ID div 1. and then we have got another div inside it which is div 2 and on which it is written hello, right. So this is one div and this is another div inside. So the outer div is with the ID, div 1, and the inner one is with using div 2.. And now what we are doing is we have got these sliders right, So we have got the rotate label and the input type is range, and minimum and maximum values are provided. So by default the value is 45 and on change we are saying the function is change rotation And this change rotation function is written here. Have you used functions in your project at the moment? Have you covered functions? Okay, so, like normally in any other programming language, you write functions, which makes your life easier, right, Because if you are using that function at different places, you don't have to change it, you just have to call it. But if you want to make some changes, you just have to make it at one place. okay, So you write function using a keyword function and then you give a name of the function And if that function has a parameter, then you write the parameter in the brackets, So function again can be in the script part. So I'm not sure if you have started the JavaScript yet or not. okay, So maybe, like Sally, Jo will cover JavaScript more in detail. But because this example has got some functions, so we can just have a bit of overview of that. So JavaScript is usually written inside the script tags. So you start the script and then you end the script and whatever inside is written is the JavaScript. okay, So JavaScript is normally a scripting language where you can write your functions. So what we have got is here: we have got two functions. The first one we are looking at is change rotation function, which has got a parameter, and that parameter is the value. So the value is coming from that input that we have just seen. okay, So again now how you know that you want to apply that particular function on that particular element of your HTML. So for that we have got different ways of accessing the elements, either by ID or by class, right? So we are saying document. so which is your entire HTML document, document, dot. element by ID. okay, So again, when you are writing get element by ID, so you have to make sure that you are writing it in the same way as it's written here, that E is uppercase, B is uppercase and I is uppercase, otherwise it won't be able to do the thing that you want to do. So you have to make sure that you are writing this in a similar way. So get element by ID, div 2, which is this div, which is the internal div, right? So we are applying this function on div 2 and what we are doing is we are changing the style. So dot style, dot transform is equal to: we want to rotate it by the value, whichever is the default value. So in this case, the default value of div 2, this range is 45,. right Now we are saying: plus, whatever degree, it is okay. So, whatever degree we get from the normal value, plus or minus the value which it is choosing, okay. And similarly, for what we want to do is we want to use the different styling, right? I think these things you have not covered it yet, so I won't go into the detail Sally Jo will cover. when it comes to the JavaScript card: okay, So, but you can normally apply the rotation function. Plus is for concatenation here, okay. So whatever is the value, plus the degree by which the value is being chosen here, okay. And when you are calling this function, so you are calling it here. that on change, okay. So when this value is changed, so you are calling the change rotation function and we are saying this: dot value. So whatever the value is, we are applying that as a parameter, okay. So rotate by 97 degrees or rotate by 360 degrees? okay. So this value will become the value in this parameter, okay. And then you apply the transform. this is just the label, okay. And then there are two breaks here so you can see a bit of gap. And then x-axis, and then again the input type is range. You provide the minimum and the maximum values and the default value, And then you are calling the on change, that on change, whenever the user is changing the sliding this range. So the change org function is called. and this is the change org function Again, which is applying some transformation functions on it. But I think you won't be able to get this one because you haven't started with the basics of JavaScript. So this will make more sense when you start with the JavaScript later in the weeks. So, but just a bit of overview. like this is how we write the functions, okay. So this is how the offset- sorry, transform- origin works. Now, coming back to all the slides, Another one. so these are all about the transformations: Rotating, scaling, skewing, translating, transform origin. okay. Now another property is transition. So transition means a movement, passage or change from one position, state change, subject, concept, et cetera- to another one. So that's a normal English definition, But as per CSS trick. so the transition property is a shorthand property which is used to represent up to four transitions related longhand properties that allow elements to change values over a specified duration, animating the property changes rather than having them occur immediately. So what does that mean? We have got various transition properties: Transition, transition property, transition duration, transition timing function and transition delay. We will have a look at those. So the syntax is again very similar to what we have seen with the transformation. So you have got the transition property, colon, and then you apply the property, You tell the duration of that property, You apply the timing function and you tell the how much delay do you want? And then end it with a semicolon. So this is how you can write it in a single line. But also you can write it in different lines as well, by saying transition property and then you define the property or transition duration and apply the duration, transition timing function and call the timing function and the transition delay, or you apply the value of the delay. So either way is correct. This is just a shorthand and this is just a long way of writing this. So you must specify two things: The CSS property you want to add an effect to and the duration of that effect- Okay, And if the duration is not specified, the transition will have no effect because the default value is zero. So, with the property. so this specify which property or properties will be impacted by the transition. So in the transition property you can have either none, or property initial or inherit- Okay, If it is none, so that means no property will get any transition effect. If it is all which is a default value, Okay, And all properties will get that transition effect. Then you specify the property: It defines a comma separated list of CSS property names that the transition effect is for. Initial sets this property to its default value. and inherit means if it is inheriting any property, property from the parent element And if it is a duration. so then you have to specify the time. You can specify either in seconds or in milliseconds, It can have multiple time values which can be separated by commas, Or it can have initial or inherit, if it is inheriting from the parent or if it has already called some initial value. And the timing property: it specifies the pace at which the transition will run. Okay, So these are some values that are accepted. So either ease, linear, ease in, ease out, ease in out, step start, step end, custom cubic Bezier curve value or custom stepping function value. So we can have a look at the example. And then there is a delay property which, so you will specify when the transition will restart relative to the instant the property value changes. Okay, So the value is: either you can specify the number of seconds or milliseconds, or initial, which is default value, or inherit, if it is inheriting from the parent element. Okay, So let's have a look at the example. So now what we have got is in the body, we have got the heading and then we have got five different divs. Okay, So, with the linear ease, ease in, ease out and ease in out. Okay, Now how this is effecting. So similar, very similar way, you have got a div with these properties, Okay, And the transition. we are saying width is two seconds, Okay. So with the div one, which is this: okay, we are saying hash div one, because it's ID is hash div one. We are saying transition timing function is linear. So you can see here it is in a linear transition. The second one is ease. The second is ease in, ease out and ease in out. So you have to hover over the element div to see the different transition effects. Okay, Now again div over. so width, it goes up to 300 pixel when you put the div. So these are very similar to the like. when you make the PowerPoint presentation, you see the different effects that you can put in the text or images or whatever. So, similar way, transition timing function works in CSS. Now animation, which is the more interesting part, right So? it is a state or a condition of being animated. It's quite understandable. animation, We all do animation when we make the PowerPoint presentations, right So? but as per the W3C, so it is a way for authors to animate the value of CSS properties over time using keyframes. The behavior of these keyframe animations can be controlled by specifying their duration, number of repeats and repeating behavior. So when you are doing the animation in CSS, so you use the keyframes, which is established, which establish the behavior of an animation over time. So when you specify CSS style inside the keyframe rules, the animation will gradually change from the grunt style to a new style at a certain particular time. Now, to get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element, Similarly, like when you do the CSS, you must bind that CSS property to that particular element. Similarly we have to do it with the animation, but you have to define whatever the animation you want in the keyframe. So there are different things that can be specified. So you can specify the animation duration: Okay, we specify the length of the time one cycle of the animation will take place. The syntax is animation duration. and then you have to provide the values, And the accepted values are either the time in seconds or the time in milliseconds. And then you have to specify the name of the property, So what type of animation that should be applied to a particular element. So again, animation name, and it can be any custom value you can provide, but the custom string with no spaces. So whatever value you are providing or whatever name you are providing to that particular animation- So this is the naming constraint, that it should not have any space in between. Okay, so it should be just one single word or a combination of both words, but no spaces in it. Then you also provide the iteration count property and you just provide the value, So it could be the number of times you want that animation to cycle through that run. So the accepted values are either a number, or you can say infinite, that will keep on going- Or initial value or some inherent value which is coming from the current animation. So this is how the syntax is to call the animation: For example, dot element. So dot is for class, So dot, that particular class name of that element. And then you are saying animation duration and provide the value animation name, which could be the custom value. Okay, So this is the thing that you have, provided that this is the animation that you want. So, for example, at the rate, keyframes, so whatever you are defining inside the keyframe, Okay, And then you provide any animation name of your choice. Then you are saying, using the keyframe location, whatever the CSS properties that you want, For example, for that particular div, you want the color to change it to red, blue, yellow and keep on changing to those colors. You can have different keyframes defined in it. Okay, So animation name: it could be any string from your CSS keyframe location. Waypoint of the animation: it can either be percentages between 0 to 100% or, in case of animation with only two waypoints, the keyword is: from this to particular, this And then CSS properties: are the any CSS properties that you can provide. There are a list of properties here in the link that can be you can refer to. So these are the color or the length, or there are a list of properties determined and various others. So you can have a go through these and you can see how the animations are used. You can play around with some examples. All the details are given in this link. So, for example, for that particular paragraph you want the animation duration to be three seconds. animation name is slide in. iteration count is infinite, that it keeps on going and the direction is alternate, Or it could be using a shorthand, so you can provide everything in one line as well. And you can also provide different animation properties by saying fade in and then move left to 300 pixels and then bounce. So it will all happens in the sequence. So first it will fade in, fade out and then it will be moved to the left to 300 pixels and then it will bounce And then duration is fade in, fade out will be 2.5 seconds, move left is 5 seconds and then bounce is 1 second and the iteration is that it will fade in 2 times, move left 1 time and bounce is 5 times. So this is how you can provide the different properties, So you can have a look at these different examples and play around with your project and apply some animations. So this is what we have seen. So that's all for today's lecture. So that was all about CSS transformation, translation and the animations. Now the goal is I think you will- Sally Jo will open or pay more, fill the tutors for this paper. Okay, so they will open a practical as well for this particular topic, which will give you more insight, because you will be playing around with these things And then you try to apply that in your project. So that's all for today's lecture.
