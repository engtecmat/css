<h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
<p>
    Okay, let's get started. All right, welcome back to week nine. Thank you all for sticking it out this long. Today we're going to start getting into the really, really cool stuff about this paper. I'm going to start talking about JavaScript, So, if I can manage to get to the next screen, yes, This is where you can take your project and start doing some of the more well, more interesting things. At this point, we're going to start looking at ways that you can make your webpages actually really interactive, So you can do some things- interactive things- without using JavaScript, In fact, without even using CSS. HTML forms is a part of HTML that was developed to allow you to do some very simple interactive things, particularly in the way of setting up, well, the sort of form that you're used to when you're purchasing something or registering for something. So the idea with the interactive web, as it was set up in that way, was that you had the server-side computation that the stuff in the browser that you set up for the browser is going to be pretty passive. You allow people to enter in some information and then they click submit, something like that, And that literally submits the paper, the web page information to the server And a program on the server does some stuff and then sends back the reformatted web page, the notification that you have indeed registered for the event, whatever is appropriate, back to the browser And you can, as I say, do some fairly interesting things. It has a lot of HTML forms, has a lot of the interactive elements that you're used to seeing. It's got buttons, text fields, lists, pull-down lists, things like that. It was largely based on what you see and what you saw in the old-fashioned paper forms that people filled out. Well, we didn't cover HTML forms in this paper because mostly it isn't used anymore. Most forms are now either are now a combination of some JavaScript processing in the browser and then further processing on the server after the form is submitted. So you're going to look at the JavaScript processing in the browser in this paper and then, as I'll mention later on, if you go on further in our web programming series of papers, then you're going to get into some even more exciting stuff about PHP and MySQL, things like that. that's going to cover how you create the programs that do that server-side processing. Okay, so just a little bit more about HTL Forum. If you've ever looked closely at the URL for something that has used a form. this is pretty much what it looks like. You've got a text field and here at the Trade Me example, the text field is going to be this box and it's going to wait for a search string that's going to be input by the user. It's given an initial value of nothing, which is appropriate, and when a person types in their search string- in this case computer- and then clicks on the Submit button, then this is constructed. This URL is sent to the server-side processor that contains the information of what the user typed in and then what should be done with that thing. And a little bit of interesting stuff is that these HTML form elements also have some little prettying up defaults. So in this case, autocomplete is off, but it is possible to set up autocomplete through using HTML forms, All right. so just a little bit of a technology overview as to the technologies that we're covering in this paper, so you see more clearly what's happened and then what you're going to learn next. So, basic HTML: that is the basis of everything that you're doing in this paper. That is the basis for setting up the simple web page, The content, the structure of it, and then the hyperlinks, hypertext. Well, we discovered pretty early on that. that's a pretty bare-bone set of functionality. So the next layer of technology is the cascading style sheets. that lets you do some nicer things. You can set up the presentation, the style, the layout and be pretty creative with it and be very specific about it. But again, you can use some tricks, but that's pretty static. So next we're going into dynamic pages where you can do interesting things. What we're going to cover today is the cascading- Oh no, You have covered the cascading- style sheet- transforms, transitions and animations. That was last week with Sapna. You're going to explore animated GIFs, audio and video as you go through the paper and as you try to come up with more interesting things for your project to include. And then we're going to concentrate on the interactivity part of JavaScript over these last couple of weeks- And again that's going to be mainly pretty exclusively looking at the server-side programs that you can set up. Okay, Always got to do a little bit of boring history background stuff. So JavaScript is actually kind of an interesting technology in that the name JavaScript is a trademark, a trademark of the Oracle company. That's a little bit unusual. That's a lot unusual. You don't look at the other standard programming languages and discover that they've been trademarked. Nobody has trademarked C++, for example. So where did it come from? Well, again, this is going to be ancient history for you all, But Netscape was one of the first big browsers. The companies had developed a browser And they developed it early on in the days of the web to use it, to construct and to add functionality to their Netscape Navigator web browser. And they didn't call it JavaScript originally. So at that point, Java was indeed a big, hot programming language. It's still very hot today. And so, yeah, they wanted to kind of play off of that, And so they originally called it Mocha. And well, that's thinking through the marketing sense that was going around at the time. Well, Mocha isn't that closely associated with Java. Then they switched to LiveScript, And well, that name obviously isn't very exciting at all. So then they settled on JavaScript. So, yeah, they went for a JavaScript, mainly as a, as an attempt to associate themselves with Java, not to actually violate trademark and to really cash in on the excitement about Java. Other thing to note is that JavaScript is spelled exactly like this: capital J, capital S. That was also a period of time when it was the trendy thing to have a capital letter in the middle of whatever you were, you were naming. It is important that you actually use the capital S, because if you don't, it makes you look kind of like you're not as familiar with the text scene as you, as you ought to be. OK, so JavaScript is trademarked. Well, it also turns out that there's a non-trademarked name, ECMAScript, that is showing its association with the European Computer Manufacturers Association, And that's a standards organization, and I've been talking to you at length about standards organizations- and that is, was and continues to be the organization that approves the evolving standard for JavaScript or ECMAScript. But yeah, ECMAScript, you're free to use it. No trademark involved JavaScript. technically you ought to license the use of it, of the name, but nobody does So that's. it's basically a trademark that they've kind of let go of, that it's coming to such common use that it would be very difficult for them to try to reassert their ownership and the value of that JavaScript name. So, long story short, if you really want to be pedantic- and who among us does not- then you can talk about using ECMAScript when you're trying to impress, But JavaScript is pretty much always used instead. All right, so now I can actually start talking about JavaScript itself. So, yeah, what was the why they felt the need for having a language like JavaScript is, well, you know, thinking back to what the web looks like without it. you've got your documents set up using the cascading style sheets- HTML- So that consists of the text and its structure and some links and the styles that you apply to it. And these links, these URLs, can point to programs on the server that do the things that you need, But to simply do processing on your document using that old-fashioned, that more old-fashioned technology. that means that every time that you want to do some sort of calculation, every time you want to do some sort of transformation, then you have to send that information to the server. There's going to be a page reload, basically for every single step, And that puts a lot of load on the server. You know, with the projects you all are doing, it's envisaged that there's only going to ever be one person using your project, clicking on the links in your project at a time. So that's not so bad. but if we were thinking about these projects as being part of a larger system that's going to see thousands, millions of users at a time, then that's going to be problematic Every time you want to have something done, then the page and its information has to be sent to the central server. it has to do the processing, sends the page back. You multiply that by a million people all at once and yeah, So JavaScript recognized that problem very early on in the days of the web And it set up client-side computation and this is obviously going to balance some of the load. It's going to decentralize some and, as you know, not all of the processing, but that means that you're cutting out a lot of processing time, a lot of send times, and that, of course, is going to make your interactive project work a lot faster, if you know, if it were going to be used by many people. Okay, so I've been also saying some kind of general things about how you're going to do some processing on the client side, and there are two main reasons that, two main things that JavaScript was set up to do. So it's going well. it's mainly going to dynamically read, modify the content and or the presentation of the page. So two big things that you're going to be looking to do in your project to find out what when you might want to reorder the, modify the presentation, maybe for certain users, for certain pages You're going to add some animation, or you're going to switch to a different font, different set of colors for various bits of information, Or maybe you're going to do a little bit of simple processing. Maybe you're going to reorder some links, maybe you're going to change some links And, long story short, all of this has come to a head mainly over the past 15 years, which, again, I know sounds like forever in terms of the web, But it's actually been a really interesting move, as the web content has been changing to look more like desktop laptop content And, at the same time, desktop laptop content has been changing its appearance to look more and more like the web stuff. So the two technologies have pretty much converged at this point. All right. so finally, some details here. So remember how there were three ways to handle cascading style sheets, to include those commands. Well, it's the same thing with JavaScript. You can set up your JavaScript where the command, the processing instructions, are inline- They're actually inside the HTML code element, They're internal- where you can set up a script that's still inside the HTML And that's obviously going to allow you to include a lot more in the way of instructions Or what's generally encouraged, so that we get more readable code is to have an external script, To set up the same sort of script but put it in an external file from your actual HTML code. So inline, that's mainly done as an event handler, And the big example- you are only going to look at a couple of these things in this paper- looks a lot like this. So here's a sort of a- I hesitate to call it- trick, but this is a skill that you all should be developing right at the moment. So you've never. you've never seen JavaScript. You've never seen. you've never seen an event handler like OneClick in JavaScript. But by this point, if you've done another programming language, then you should be able to start interpreting that even without knowing JavaScript, And not just if you've done a bit of programming. by the time you've looked at cascading style sheets enough, this sort of structure should start looking familiar to you. So, basically, my big advice is: when you're learning a new language, when you're learning a new set of functionality, try to look at it and puzzle out as much as you can about what that thing likely means, what it likely does, And then, of course, go to the documentation, make sure that you understand it. And I'm suggesting that because, well, that's just the most effective way to learn another language is to start picking up on general structures, on general ways that things are done. So, doing that, okay, I've got something with delimiters here of button and then it ends there with slash button and stuff. Okay, so that tells me that, whatever it is that this thing is, it's a button And you know we've seen buttons on screen and this is an on screen sort of language. So, okay, starting to get it in my head what that likely is, It's confirmed, it's a type button, Okay, Okay, All right. Okay, OnClick equals alert, clicked, Okay. Well, whenever I see things like this, that usually means, you know, between the double quotes, that usually means that this is a message And it's probably not a comment, because we know how comments look. So if it's a message, it's probably going to be displayed And all right. Then this click me thing: Okay, OnClick equals this and then click me, All right. So best guess- and of course I have confirmed this, I've looked it up- is that this is going to create a button. It's going to have the label on the button of click me And onClick is an event handler. that is going to a method that's going to display clicked as the message. Well, sorry, I should put alert clicked. Sorry about that, Um, Nope, Clicked. So, uh, yeah, I'm looking at that and I can kind of puzzle out what it is what it does. And then, of course, we know about buttons that they can have different appearances, they can be in different parts of the page. So, yeah, we know that there are probably going, there will be- a lot of other attributes that we can apply to change the appearance of the button, And we see already how we can change the label on the button and how we can change the message that has popped up whenever this thing is clicked. So, yeah, uh, there are, of course, other types of events And for this paper we're only going to look at a couple of them, And not not necessarily in the lectures, but certainly in the, in the tutorials and in your project. The idea of setting a focus: uh, where the? uh, a set of focus? sorry, I don't know why I'm having such a hard time putting my sentences together today, For where the mouse is blur, which is a loss of focus. for where the mouse is? Uh, looking at cursor movements? uh, what happens on mouse over for a button when you don't, or something when you don't necessarily click on it And then page load. So there's a, a handy little URL there that I strongly suggest you look at. Oh, let's see, Yeah, Where uh it okay, Where uh, where a lot of these events are explained, Lots of examples where you can click on things and see what happens. Uh, a look at all, uh, not just the one, those, those particular sets of event handlers, but all sorts of other event handlers, more examples. Remember that that's the best way to try to learn how to do anything with uh, with web technology, is to look at, look at the examples and then figure out what you need to to copy, what you need to modify, to create that sort of effect yourself. Let's go back to the PowerPoint. Uh, a little bit of interesting, uh of interest as well. Uh, when you use that particular inline link model, uh, inline, uh JavaScript instructions, then you're basically breaking the sort of link model of the web. So, uh, as an example, uh, if, if you've played around with the paper outline system here at Waikato and I'm since you've managed to actually successfully uh enroll in papers- I'm assuming that you have- You've probably noticed that you know there's the webpage paper outlines. and then you see these things that look like web links. You click on them and you do get to another webpage, but they don't actually work the way that we'd expect for a normal webpage. So we can't, for example, bookmark my, my outlines and we can't open my outlines in a new tab. And you may have puzzled about that, uh, or just assumed that something was broken. But no, uh, that occur, that behavior occurs because this part of the webpage was set up with inline JavaScript instructions. So, yeah, just a little bit of of um information that you know is is basically, it's letting you be an insider, That here's something a bit unusual that's happening on a webpage, and you can now, uh, develop an explanation for why that or for how that happens. And then, of course, we can think about: well, why, why would they want to do that? Why would they want to deliberately set up something where, uh, that special webpage can't be bookmarked? Any, any thoughts on that? Well, uh, one thing: uh, you, you only have access to the paper outline system, well, to the my, my outlines part of the paper outline system, if you're actually an enrolled student. So, uh, if they didn't do it this way, then it would make it much easier for people who are not enrolled to get into parts of the system that they should not be allowed to get into because they aren't that type of user. So, yeah, there are some. there are, there are some very good reasons for for using the inline model for the JavaScript instructions. Let's see, Ah, And these inline instructions work exactly the way that you'd think that they would, uh, since they're based on the same sort of uh functionality, the same sort of structure as the cascading style sheets in inline instructions. So, uh, you've got the instruction and that, uh, no, I'm sorry, I've moved on to internal. Uh, the internal is the one that is has the instructions inside the script. Again, works exactly the same way as cascading style sheets. You've uh got your script. uh, that, that includes the JavaScript instructions. That script is encountered whenever the script- I'm sorry, the script- is executed whenever it's encountered. And only a little bit of of thing that, uh, we wanted to point out here is that in the old HTML4, you actually had to put the um, the text type is the text JavaScript. That has been obsolete, uh, since HTML5, you don't need to include that. It's uh, the the instructions are assumed to be JavaScript, But if you encounter an old program or, for some reason, if you encounter, uh, the um, uh, something that's running HTML4 or- God help us- HTML3, this is a good thing to know. All right, So again, why, why do the internal thing? Uh, the inline event handling, again, is pretty much limited to one instruction, And having a bunch of inline events scattered throughout your, your program, scattered throughout your HTML, starts being really messy, starts being really difficult to uh for a person to follow. So, for exactly the same reason, as you go to an internal uh for CSS, you do that for your JavaScript, That you are able to set aside the instructions that you want to have happen and then to reference that script every time you you run across that need. And this one actually is also kind of an interesting thing. Uh, you're setting a click event to happen whenever there's a paragraph that needs to be clicked or that is clicked. So that's just a little bit of an interesting thing that you don't have to have a single word, you don't have to have a button, that any other form elements can actually be made clickable, can actually be made to function as a button with JavaScript. All right. And then I said the last, uh, the third type of uh JavaScript scripts are the external ones, And we make them external for exactly the same reasons as we did with CSS. That, uh again, if you have these big uh script files, or big set of script instructions, scattered throughout your software, scattered throughout the HTML, it can be, it can make it harder to read, It can detract from being able to see the overall structure of the HTML. So you handle it just the way you did with CSS: That you uh set up a link to the spot that actually does have the JavaScript file with the JavaScript instructions. And uh, again, just as a reminder, that file can be local, in which case you specify the local file path, Or it can be something external, in which case you specify the URL And for your project, we're assuming that a lot of the JavaScript files that you create for your project are indeed going to be local. It's just going to be something that you created that's there in your home directory. Okay, so I kind of fibbed when I said that, uh, there are three ways to handle JavaScript. Uh, the fourth of the of the three ways is to set up something that's amusingly called a bookmarklet. And well, why would you do that, Well, you've uh, if you uh, if you use the old web, or if you've had somebody who has not kept up with things uh, set up a web page that you use that has a lot of uh of old, internal, in particular, JavaScript, then, well, you know you, it does something, It sets up an alert message or or, or whatever, But again, you can't open it into a new tab And it's difficult to get rid of it, particularly if it's a, if it's playing music or something like that. So bookmarklets are JavaScript URLs, little uh JavaScript, uh links to JavaScript code that perform some named task. It's usually a fairly small task And okay, again a little bit of back history here before I show you a couple. Uh, they're actually less popular now, uh, because there has been increasing, of course, uh focus on security for uh, for websites, web pages And sites that have a content security policy often implement strict controls uh and block these bookmarklets from running Because, again, this could be anything uh that is in that link. So, assuming that uh, a user knows what's going to happen in that bookmarklet and has really kept up with who created the bookmarklet and how it works uh is a bit of an ask for things like high security platforms, or even for a lot of schools, universities, Because, again, you know young, young people, presumably a bit naive, And also, like I said, these bookmarklets perform some named and useful task for you. So a lot of uh a lot of the older bookmarklets have been turned into browser extensions and formalized that way And those are obviously uh quite a bit more secure. But just to talk about it a little bit and give you a few examples, uh, there are bookmarklets that are still being created, that are still, um, that are still in use And in fact, uh are seeing quite a bit of use for particular types of needs. The one I'm going to talk about or show you next is for uh accessibility audits, The idea that you want to check out uh how accessible your webpage that you're creating is for people with various uh types of special needs. Uh also search engine analysis: How, looking at how uh well quick, uh quantitative looks at what a search engine is likely to uh come away with in from your particular webpage- Uh little functionality to make page editing a little bit easier. Or or to set up uh quick demos for teaching. That's one thing that a lot of these bookmarklets get used for with teachers, Or various utilities like, uh, the QR code generator is is pretty popular as well. So let me right, where'd you go? Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope. And of course, I set that up as a picture at the last minute, Did I actually? Ah, okay, So one, uh. one really useful thing about bookmarklets is that adding a bookmarklet is super, super fast, super, super easy. All you do is find that bookmarklet, uh, find the link to it, and then drag and drop that bookmarklet link into your into your bookmarks bar, and then there it is. And then, once it's there, uh, then all you have to do is click on it to use it. You click on it and then it will do whatever to your, uh, your webpage. And again, last- Sorry, it's gonna be too much trouble to actually show you an example, but I strongly suggest that you all look at the, at the accessibility bookmarklets in particular. So let's see if I can remember enough- to, uh, pauljadamcom, Okay, so, yeah, you see all sorts of things that are actually really useful for getting a quick idea of how accessible that your web page is. And yes, I know that there are browser extensions. I know that there are web pages that will do formal audits for you, but a really cool thing about bookmarklets is that you can do a really quick check while you're actually working on your web page. So, for example, let's see if this is it and again sorry, bookmarks bar. anybody know where the bookmarks bar is in Chrome? Oh, at any rate, if I knew a bit more about Chrome- I know this is embarrassing on PC- then all I do is move that bookmarklets link over there, And then, when I clicked on it, it would tell me what the alt text is for each of these images. And that is a test that you should apply to an awful lot of different web pages, because it's just appalling. the alt image text is what people who use screen readers have to rely on, And the alt image text is usually either blank or it's something like an image. Okay, Okay, All right, Back to this. Wow, You all are. how are you all doing in this semester? Everybody looks pretty glum and you all are, frankly, just sucking the energy right out of me. This is not a good way to start a week, Okay, So I promise next week I'm going to come with a really razzle-dazzle, exciting example to show you, and maybe we can pump it up a little bit. Come on, Let's see What's the point of this one. Oh yeah, You're going to change page content with JavaScript. So, all right, You already know, or you can see, how you can open new windows, you can set up dialog boxes, you can change values of a location, but to change the content, well, got to know how to do that, and that's what JavaScript is good for. but you also need to know, again, what part of the page, what part of the content, that you want to change. So that's what you get when you're looking at using both JavaScript and CSS, and that helps you to uniquely identify which particular element that you want to do something with. So, JavaScript, you need to specify a precise element using the ID attribute, and that's the same sort of thing that you did with CSS. And then the getElementById method is going to let you- to actually let you- to produce a reference to that specific element that you name with that attribute. And, of course, when you're giving a reference to an element on a page, there should only be one of that thing, because the ID attribute values are supposed to be, or have to be, unique on that page. Okay then, okay, you've figured out what it is that you want to do something to, and now you need to say what to do to it. Well, you use something called an assignment statement, and I'm assuming that most of you all have done some sort of little programming, in which case the assignment statement is going to be very familiar to you. Don't worry if you haven't done any programming. The big trick here is that this is an assignment statement and not, as it appears, an equal sign. The difference is that the assignment statement says: you see this thing that looks like an equal sign. Don't let it fool you. The assignment statement tells you that the software is going to take that value and give this element the value, So not mathematical equals. It's saying this particular element is assigned the value, the new value of that. Only trick that you're going to encounter. really Well, okay, dibbed on that as well. There are always a couple of extra little tricks. So JavaScript names for properties are slightly different than with the CSS. So you remember, with CSS you could name a font family and it was written this way: font-family- lowercase. Well, in JavaScript it's font-family with an initial capital, F, no hyphen, all smish together. And you're saying to yourself: wow, that's dumb, That is just rife for causing problems. That is very likely to cause errors And yes, yes it is. This is a problem basically based on having the standards committee for CSS and for JavaScript being set by two different organizations And, quite frankly, the people in both the CSS standards and the JavaScript standards haven't been able to climb down from their high horses and agree to go with one or the other. So you'll see little bits of that sort of conflict if you do CS Max 270. The idea that you know, here are these very, very, we would think, cut and dry. absolutely no emotion involved. These are just some technical decisions to be made as to which particular string of letters should represent a specific functionality. But when you get people involved- and people are involved in setting up standards- then we get people's egos involved And that means that some very cut and dry technical decisions can turn into a battle royale. So, yeah, another common type of error that can creep in is getting the case on the method name wrong And, again, very important, getElementBy capital ID is correct. So capital I, capital D, capital D- the way that humans usually represent ID- is wrong. Again, this is completely arbitrary. There is no way to come up with a logical argument that will convince everybody that one is correct and the other is not. So the workaround- failing you being able to memorize every single detail about every single function or method or attribute or style- that's required is to choose your programming environment, your IDE, very carefully. So if you choose the right editor, it's going to give you a lot of help in picking out the correct names for you. Another thing that we want you to start looking at is some of the ways that you can test your code, Because, as I say, when you get into JavaScript, it really is testing the JavaScript. So those of you who have done some programming before are going to know about setting up print statements to help you to trace where you are, where the processing goes in your program and what might be going wrong. You can do the same sort of thing by logging your output to a console log and then inserting some of the many functions that will help you to trace through what's happening, And again, strongly advise you to look through some of the hints on that page, And, of course, there are many other sources of information about how to do testing the most effective way. So, yeah, the other thing that you had in CSS were the validators And you went through some exercises where you used the validators and we hope you're continuing to use them for your project. Unfortunately, there aren't to be validators as such for JavaScript. There are a couple of things called lint tools, but they give lots of style warnings And at this point, nobody is that concerned about style, And you might find the output to be more alarming than helpful, getting this big blast of things about how this is good style for HTML 4, but not for 5.. So, yeah, our best advice to you is to check your editor, your IDE, and make sure you're using one that is JavaScript-aware, And also to look through those examples of how to use your browser console to help you to trace through what's going on in your programs. You can also have a look at testing yourself the JavaScript requirements for various types of web content. So turn JavaScript off in your browser And then look through your usual, your favorite websites and see what breaks, see what goes wrong, And, of course, we always ask you to do that to your own software so that you're aware of what it is that you're putting into your page that might prevent some people from being able to use your work. It doesn't matter really that much for this project, because you're not going to be sending your project out for the rest of the world to work with. But there are a lot of sites, as I said, that don't allow JavaScript. And well, also trying to turn off JavaScript, that can also be used as a security measure. Whenever you think that you might not be looking at a particularly safe place, or if you want to see how safe it is, turn off the JavaScript and see what breaks, See if there's something that looks like it might have been trying to do a JavaScript attack. So, yeah, big warning for that is that JavaScript is one of the sources of web security issues, shall we say. The big deal is that anyone can write web content. That's a big strength. Anyone can write JavaScript programs in web content. Again, big strength is for design, for presenting your information, But again, these are programs that run on your machine, in your browser, and that means that, yeah, it's starting to make you vulnerable, Particularly for having this JavaScript access other information in your browser, like your cookies, like your history. So, if you want to learn more about web development, the technical side is going to come in COM 225, where you're going to get an introduction to PHP and get a good focus on using simple databases on the web. And then 322, advanced web development, where you do all sorts of really fancy stuff. And then we also have third and fifth year papers that deal with web security, that have an emphasis on trying to get around some of these JavaScript issues And just and the more complicated and interesting web security issues. So okay, Oh goodness, I've sucked up an extra four minutes of your lives. Apologies, But yeah, I think in week 8 I took like 10 minutes less, so we're more or less even here. I'll see you next week. I'd love to drink some coffee or something before you come here. I'll show you mine. Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
