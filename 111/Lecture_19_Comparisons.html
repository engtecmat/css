<h1>Lecture 19 Comparisons</h1>
<p>
    I'm gonna press that, oops. okay, all right. so before we start, I just wanna talk a little bit about how this week is going to work. In particular, what I mean by that is- some of you may be aware- that Thursday is Kingitanga Day here at the university, right? Practically speaking, what that means for this class is that there are no classes running on Thursday. okay, so we won't have a lecture and we won't have the workshop. okay, That's pretty much it. There won't be a replacement lecture, no replacement, anything like that. we'll just not have any classes on Thursday this week. There is still going to be a workshop that's gonna operate out of Tooronga. Their workshop runs on Wednesdays. so I'll still have a workshop. It will be recorded. so if you're interested, you can still check into that. I think the worksheet's already up on Moodle. so if you take a look and you wanna walk through that and see that stuff, that will be up on Moodle late Wednesday afternoon, okay, But yeah, so just two lectures this week. Don't turn up on Thursday. I mean you can, it's just I won't be here. I mean I'll be in my office but not in the lecture theater there. yeah, All right, Let's see. where did we get up to. So what we're going to be doing today is introducing, or starting the idea of talking about comparing two populations, right? So so far, what we've done is a lot of emphasis on one population or one group of animals or one group of people, right? So I'm interested in the average height of everyone in New Zealand, or the average number of quills that this group of echinna has, or so forth. What we're going to do now is compare two populations, okay? So let's just look back onto our cake data here I've got. if you remember, this is about the breaking angles of cakes. So what they did is they baked a lot of cakes, a bunch with recipe one and a bunch with recipe two, And the idea is: how much do you have to bend the cake before it sort of falls apart or snaps into multiple pieces, right? And so they're sort of asking the question, you know, is one recipe stronger or more flexible or structurally more concrete-y? That's not, that's, you don't want your cake to taste like concrete, Anyway, you know what I mean. They're measuring, sort of the structural strength of the cake by how much you have to bend it before it breaks, Okay? So the question is: is there a difference between these two recipes, right? So you know. rule of thumb, first thing. if you're not sure, um, no, what? why, oh, is this gonna do what I think it does? Okay, See how I? I hate Excel, like that's not what the plot's supposed to look like, Useless, uh, what's the easiest way to fix this? Ah, Oh, actually, maybe there was a smarter way to fix this. Ah, So, um, Excel's stupid because it can't work out whether those are numbers or labels for recipe one or recipe two. So let's see if I just make them clearer that they're labels recipe A and recipe B, What You're really doing this to me, Excel? Okay, All right, We made it. I hate this software so much. Okay, Uh, so what have we got? We've got, we've got break angles for cake recipes A and B. So the question is which recipe should use, right, Or is there a difference between the two recipes? Is one better, Is one worse? I mean, they're all fairly similar, but if anything, B might be a little bit lower. There's a slightly lower break angle for those cakes, Okay, Um, hmm, Well, what else do we know how to do now? So we know how to say: well, what do I think that the average break angle for recipe A is. I could calculate a confidence interval for that. or I could look at the average recipe for B and I could calculate a confidence interval for that, and I would be 95% sure the confidence interval for recipe A is between these two values and for recipe B, the same thing. So we could do that. All right, Why is this? Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh. Okay, That Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. All right, All the recipe A data: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. That here, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. We can do the same thing for all the recipe B data. We could collect it all. Oops, Uh, That was not helpful. Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. Okay. so I know we did this on Friday, but just sort of recap so everyone can remember what we're doing. This one is recipe A, This one is recipe B, Okay. So the question is: do we think there's a difference between these two recipes Or, based on this data, can we come up with a recommendation on which cake is stronger or more robust, or which cake is the higher break angle, or so forth? Now the idea is, you know, this is recipe A. the sample mean that I saw was 33.12.. So the question is: those two are pretty close. So how do we feel about that? They're sort of pretty close, but not. well, yeah, do we think there's a difference or not? So one of the ways we could do this, we could calculate a confidence animal. We'll just do this quickly: take the mean and subtract that, And I'll take the mean and I'll add that Mean and subtract that, Or the mean and add that. Okay, so we are, say, 95% confident that recipe A, the average breaking angle of recipe A, is somewhere between 31.55 and 34.69.. So I'm 95% sure it's somewhere within those ranges. Okay, For recipe B, I'm 95% sure it's between 29.89 and 33.4.. So I'm 95% sure it's between those two values. Okay, It's not. it's not entirely obvious how you could use these two confidence animals to ask yourself whether there's a difference between the two. They certainly overlap, right. This one goes from 31 to 34.. This goes 29 to 33.. They overlap. They overlap a fair bit, But then you might ask the question, right? so if I've got, So, if I'm 95% confident, one group is between these values And I'm 95% confident the other group is between these two values, just for example. So they sort of well, they could be the same, right, There are values which, in those ranges that both of them are plausible. But what if? but maybe one of them is actually out here And the other one is at. It becomes really fiddly and confusing to sort of say how sure are we or how confident are we that these two things are the same or not? right, It's fiddly and problematic, Okay. So what we're gonna do today is sort of start getting us set up to answer this sort of question, Okay, Okay, This is sort of the bit in the paper where it's sort of not that everything's been uninteresting so far. But this is the point in the paper where, at least for me, I find a bit where you're like: okay, now we're actually starting to get into something that you could actually see yourself using or you see yourself doing. right, Because what we're going to basically be asking ourselves is: I've got two groups, Can we compare them? All, right, And at the, I like to think about what is statistics? One of the things you use statistics for is to compare stuff. right? Do undergraduate students spend more time or less time at the pub compared to postgraduate students? What's the difference between the average height of male people compared to the average height of female people. right, What's the difference between, sort of, the average income of someone in Australia compared to the average income of someone in New Zealand? right, It's one thing to sort of say: right, the average income of New Zealand is, I don't know, not enough- $60,000 or whatever. Suppose that's $60,000.. That's all well and good. You can calculate that, You could calculate a confidence symbol, You could take your sample or whatever. But if you're not comparing stuff to anything else, kind of on some level, what's the point of it? right, The average income in New Zealand is $60,000. So, sort of the next most natural question is: how does that compare to other countries? Or how does that compare to other places? right, So what we're going to be doing is focusing on comparing things And hopefully people will agree that, oh okay, this is actually what you probably want to do more of. Okay, So, hopefully, this example- I think I had this example still in this year's tutorials- All right, So we've got a big dairy company with a suspicious name there, because I didn't want to. I don't want them to think I'm making up things about a company. It's a very different company. Anyway, the cows in the Taranaki region produce an average of. they claim that the cows in Taranaki produce an average of 200 liters of milk, with a standard deviation of 30 liters. And the Waikato branch are like: all right, we reckon our cows are better. right, Because you know it rains less and our grass tastes better here, or something like that. All right, So what happens? The Waikato region produces- oh, they check watch- 50 of their cows per year And these 50 cows produce an average of 210 liters of milk in the year. Okay, So this is tutorial four, I think from memory. So hopefully this is a familiar scenario. So question is- at least my first question is: well, what was the null and alternative hypotheses for this example? Okay, Well, so what did we do? We went, we said mu is the average milk of a Waikato cow And we're trying to compare the Waikato cows to the Taranaki cows. so we're like: all right, cool, Well, the Taranaki cows, we're looking at this baseline of 200.. And they wanted to prove the cows are more productive. All right, fine, Alternative hypothesis: mu is bigger than 200.. Okay, So that's what we did And you can sort of do the calculation and go through and calculate your test statistic, Compare it to the T distribution or whatever, Calculate your p-value, So forth. Great, Okay, Oh, Sorry. Okay. So got hypotheses and so forth. Okay, I might have written it in a really convincing way, because I'm a really convincing person, But if you think about it, so the Waikato branch- they're not sure how much milk their cows make. All right, So what they're gonna do, they observe some cows and then they get a sample average of 210.. Okay So, and they're gonna compare that to how much a Taranaki cow produces, which apparently they do know. They like they wouldn't know that either. Right, And for exactly the same reason that the Waikato farmers don't know what an average cow produces Over at the Taranaki branch, I don't know. They're not gonna know what the average amount of cow produces there either. Right, So sort of arbitrarily claiming in the beginning: oh yeah, it's 200. Right? So this real question of if I'm trying to compare two things like where do I even get this baseline scenario from, Or that baseline claim, Right, Like it doesn't really make sense to have that baseline in the first place If I've got two separate groups that I'm trying to compare. Okay, So what is more likely or what usually will happen, or what you'll normally see, is what we call two independent populations, Right? So what you end up doing is, rather than just collecting data from the Waikato cows, you would collect data from both groups. You'd collect some milk from Taranaki cows, You'd collect some milk from the Waikato cows, And then you would somehow compare those two, Right, You? when it comes to comparisons, usually you won't have a baseline group, You'll just have two different groups. Okay, So what? what? I'm talking about? Two in what we call two independent populations. Okay, Independent is just sort of a fancy word for two populations, that sort of sort of separate or unrelated from each other in some sense. Okay, So you just want to think about two different populations And everyone in everyone either comes from one or the other population. Okay, Right, So you know, for example, what could you have as your two groups? You could have sort of rubbish New Zealand people, Or you could have, you know, really cool Australians, Right, Two separate groups of people, Two separate populations, Two separate populations. Or you could have, you know, really cool mathematicians. Or you know people who aren't mathematicians, So just generally regarded as not very good people. Or you could have brown cows and black cows, or whatever. Right, You've got two different sorts of groups. So what is our setup going to be? Okay, So here's my advanced picture that I've prepared. If you remember the old picture, what did we have? We used to have the population, and there was a whole bunch of really good-looking people of this population, and there were parameters. There is an average height of everyone in New Zealand, and there just is a standard deviation of everyone in New Zealand. Right, You can, in theory, you could- look at every single person. You could calculate what the mean is and what the standard deviation is. In practice, though, you can't get all of that. So we had our sample, and then we had our statistics. Right, We had our sample mean and our sample standard deviations, And the idea was we were interested in what we could use, or how we could use that sample mean to say something about the population mean, Right, And so now we've sort of done enough work that we can go right. So there's two approaches we have for doing that now. You can do hypothesis testing or you could do confidence intervals. Right, If you use a confidence interval, I could say, right, based on my statistics, or what have I observed? I think the sample mean is between these two values, and I'm pretty confident about that. Okay, So here's our new setup now, Right. So, rather than one population, we now have two populations. Okay, So I've got population one. which, for example, why did I not write cool Australians? It's probably because it's implied, Right, Australians, you know pretty great people, Boo. New Zealand people, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo. Here's our baseline question: Are they different or not, Right? Is there a difference between brown cows and black cows? Are they different or not, Right? So, really general sort of question. Well, you might want to sort of say, right, well, okay, let's try and be a bit more specific. Rather than just sort of say, are these two populations the same? Maybe what we could do is focus on a particular parameter from each of those two populations, Right? Rather than just sort of it's pretty hard to. it's a pretty general question of Australians and New Zealand people. are they the same or are they different? You go, well, I don't know. In general, Australian people have two arms and two legs. New Zealand people usually have two arms and two legs as well. That seems pretty similar. On the other hand, one population's way cooler than the other one. So you know some things, yes, some things no. So why don't we actually sort of nail it down in a sense: right, We'll pick a parameter that we're interested in. So let's just say, the number of hats that people own, right? Very important topic: How many hats do I own? Does a beanie count as a hat? Probably, In that case, two. I own two hats. Yeah, not a hat person, All right. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna focus on a parameter, usually sort of the same thing from both populations, though, right? So we're looking at the number of hats an Australian owns, or the number of hats a Kiwi owns, right? We're not gonna look at the number of hats an Australian owns and compare that to the number of bananas a Kiwi person eats, right? We're not gonna compare two completely separate things. We're always gonna try and focus on the same thing, but from both populations. Okay, Then, same setup, same sort of picture, all right, I wanna know something about the average, and I wanna know something about this average. I can't observe all of these people. I can't observe all of these people either. What could I do, though? I could get a sample from my two groups. I could get a sample from my first group and I can get a sample from my second group, And I can also get standard deviations. and then the question is: I'm gonna use x1 bar, the sample mean of the first group, to say something about mu1,, the mean of the first group. I've got my sample mean of my second group, x bar 2. And I wanna compare that to mu2.. Great, But now what we wanna do is sort of we know how to do these two individual bits in a set Separately. we've spent a lot of time working on how to do this. How do we sort of do it across, right? How do we sort of do the comparison across both populations? Okay, Okay, Okay. So what we're gonna do. so I'll show you how we set this up between, set this up in the context of hypothesis testing first. Okay, So I'll start with mu1, which is the mean of the first population, and mu2,, which is the mean of the second population. And the question is: are those two the same or not? Okay, So I've got mu1, mean of population 1, mu2, mean of population 2.. Now I could study them both separately and calculate a confidence interval for each of them individually. But really, what am I interested in If I wanna know whether there's a difference between these two populations? when we say difference in sort of maths or numeracy or number land, what does difference mean. Well, that's what difference means, right, When we sort of say: what's the difference between this number and that number? What's the difference between three and eight? Take one and you subtract the other one. Okay, So what we're interested in and what we wanna focus on is that mu1 minus mu2.. So that's what we're gonna do in our hypothesis testing scenario. okay, So our now hypothesis is well, on some level. the general question is: is there a difference between those two groups, All right. Or is there a difference between the average number of hats that Australian owns compared to the average number of hats a New Zealand person owns? Okay, Okay, So I'm interested in mu1 minus mu2.. The baseline I mean this is: you don't have to set it equal to zero, but the rule of thumb is, the baseline is: assume all things are equal unless you know, unless you have some reason to think things are different. It's kind of just sort of a scientific principle or philosophical principle or something like that. right, Unless you know they're different, let's just sort of ask ourselves the question: are they different or not? Really, you're asking the question: is the difference between them equal to zero or is the difference between them not equal to zero? So that'll be my null hypothesis: mu1 minus mu2 is equal to zero. And my alternative hypothesis: well, it could be not equal to zero, So that would be your alternative hypothesis. okay, Alternatively, these is the same as mu1 is equal to mu2.. It's mu1, not equal to mu2.. If the difference between two things is equal to zero, that's the same as they're equal to each other. Okay, Same thing. If the difference between two things is not equal to zero, then those two numbers must not be the same. So these are equivalent hypotheses. People will use both. Okay, I prefer this form, though H0- mu1 minus mu2 is equal to zero. There's a few reasons why. I think in some sense it's kind of a more natural extension of what we've done so far. So before we said, null hypothesis mean is equal to a particular value, like mu is equal to eight or mu is equal to 32.. Okay, Same thing. There's a specific, but in this case it's a combination of two parameters, but we're still going. something is equal to a specific value, Okay, So this is usually my preferred form of trying to work out or setting up my hypotheses. Both of them will be fine, right, If you write H0, mu1 is equal to mu2, that's fine. If you write H0, mu1 minus mu2 is equal to zero, also fine, You're not going to get penalized one way or the other. Okay, So your alternative hypothesis is going to be mu1 not equal to mu2, or the difference is not equal to zero. And I should note, you can also still have one-sided hypotheses. You could have mu1 is bigger than mu2, or mu1 is less than mu2.. Okay So what do we have? So before today we had something like this. So if I was just going, mu is equal to six, mu is not equal to six. what did we do? We would sort of observe a sample mean of I don't know seven, standard deviation of three, and then equals 20.. We would calculate a test statistic and we would ask ourselves: this is what we observed, How far away is that from our observed value? We say x bar minus mu, over three, over square root of 20.. Okay, And then we do some p-value, et cetera. So that's what we did when we just had one population. So what are we going to do when we have two populations? Two populations, Okay. So our hypotheses change slightly. The hypotheses have two population parameters in there. now We've got mu1 and mu2.. Okay So I've collected data from two populations And that's what we have here. now I've got mu1.. I've got mu2.. And now I've got a sample. mean that I'm gonna write x bar but I'm gonna put a little one next to it to denote that's from the first population, and so forth. So I'll have x1 bar and I'll have a sample standard deviation from my first population And then I'll have s1.. Oops, These don't need bars. I'll have s1 and s2, my sample standard deviations, And then I'll have n1 and I'll have n2.. The number of observations for each of these two separate groups. So test statistic. Fundamentally it's the same idea, right? When we looked at one population, the idea is: what did we observe? We observed seven. How far away is it from our now hypothesized value of six? So we went seven minus six. Okay, Now our focus is on the difference between the two population means. So the question is, if I want to say something about the difference between the two population means, what I would do is I would take the difference between the two sample means. That's my natural choice for what I would use- And then we sort of went: one population, we said what we observed and the hypothesized value of six. We're going to do the same thing. here We observed x1 bar and x2 bar. sample means The hypothesized value. well, that's zero actually. So that's kind of convenient. Okay, There's a question: What goes into the standard error at that point? Okay, So we'll sort of unpack those details more carefully. We'll work through this with examples on Thursday. I just want to do it using Excel right now, reasonably quickly. Okay, Let's see if I can remember how to do this. Don't worry too much about what I am doing. So what I've got is some sort of thing. Let's not worry about what any of that means or what I clicked on. I've got my first variable variable, one range variable, two range. My second set's values: Hypothesized mean difference. Let's put in zero. So the question we want to ask ourselves: do we think there's a difference between these two cake recipes? So before we even sort of form a look at the hypothesis test, let's sort of think about what Gutt might say. Gutt says average for recipe one or the sample mean is 33.1.. Sample mean for recipe B: 31.6.. If I look at those two confidence intervals they're different, But one's from 31.5 to 34.5.. One's from about 30 to 33.5.. I think people would generally say there's quite a lot of overlap between those two confidence intervals There's sort of like a fair amount. you could sort of be like, oh yeah, okay, I think they could be the same, Alright, so here is how you do it in Excel automatic. We'll work through this slowly on Friday's class. So we'll work through it carefully, step by step, and just go through exactly what each of these steps are. But I didn't want to try and do that today, so I'm just going to show you what you would kind of do. So in our example, mu 1,. so this is the average break angle of recipe 1, mu 2, which is the average break angle of recipe 2.. Okay, so there's my null hypothesis. Difference between those two means is equal to zero. I'll tell you if hypothesis difference between those two means is not equal to zero. The next step in hypothesis testing is to calculate a T value or a test statistic. That is there, So it's T stat. That's our test statistic. So it's 1.2459, okay, So, notably, it does report the values. It reports the sample means. It gives you the sample variances. for some reason, If you took the square root you could get the standard deviations. Variance is just standard deviation squared. So these are: this is the mean from recipe 1.. This is the standard deviation of recipe 1.. This is the mean from recipe 2.. This is the standard deviation from recipe 2.. And these are the number of observations that we have each time. So it's exactly what I wrote here. You'd collect those values, and those are the values you'd need. You calculate some sort of test statistic And then you go, okay, so what conclusion are we gonna make? And then you'd be like, what? like why does Excel make this so hard to read? Short answer is: if we're doing a two-sided hypothesis test, for some reason they call it one tail, two tail. Forget about that stuff. If we're doing a two-sided test, we're looking for the two-tailed one. And so I don't know why it doesn't just say p-value for two-sided test, why it says that. Anyway, that's the answer for your p-value: 0.214.. 0.214.. So the conclusion we're gonna go with is: p here is bigger than 0.05.. So we do not reject the null hypothesis. So our conclusion is: yeah, those two recipes might be the same, Right, We haven't made a definitive conclusion that these two recipes are different, Okay, Which is kind of what we suspected would happen, Right? So Excel will do the whole process for you in a sense. So you get your p-value. We'll do some weird stuff, but the p-value's gonna be there, Okay, All right, Does anyone have any questions? Okay, We'll go through this whole process carefully, step-by-step, on Friday's class. We'll also do how you do this with a confidence interval, right? I mean, I've focused on hypothesis testing today, but of course we can use a confidence interval approach to answer this question as well. So we'll do that on Friday, All right? Just remember, don't turn up to class on Thursday. You can, There, just won't be anyone there. Okay, We'll come here, Let's go, I'm going to go, Okay, Okay, Thank you, We're doing this. Let's go, Let's go, Let's go. Oh, first time, Let's go, Let's go. Okay, I'm here, I want to go, I want to go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go.
