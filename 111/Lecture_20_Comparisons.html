<h1>Lecture 20 Comparisons Part 2</h1>
<p>
    Okay, let's make a start, shall we? Okay, so today what we're going to do is basically go through it carefully, step by step, of how we're going to compare two populations or, in particular, the mean of two populations. Okay, so, just to recap the general idea of what we're doing before we sort of hop into it in detail. Okay so the idea is we've got two independent populations, or two separate groups of populations. So you know, think, ooh, New Zealand people, Think about them- compared to, ooh, Australian people. Ooh, yeah, oh yeah good, that boo was for New Zealand, right, Just a bit delayed. Yeah, okay, good. Or mathematicians versus non-mathematicians, or brown cows versus black cows. So we've just got two separate groups of people or animals or whatever. And so our goal is to ask ourselves: is there a difference between these two populations? So, in particular, we're focusing on a parameter. We're going to focus on the average from each of these two populations. We're going to use our sample means from each individual population. So you collect data from both populations, You collect two separate samples And using those two samples, we're going to try and compare the two. Okay so, null hypothesis: the difference between the two population means is equal to zero. Alternative hypothesis: It's, the difference between the two population means is not equal to zero. Okay, hopefully that makes sense. That's the two minute recap of what we did Monday. Monday now, Oh, that was a while ago, Okay, so what we're going to do is run through this hypothesis test. now, How are we going to? we want to ask the general question: are these two populations the same or are they different? Okay, So the general process of what we're going to do to run this hypothesis test. if you understood or you're reasonably comfortable with how we did hypothesis testing on one population, it's analogous in a sense that all the main steps are still there in exactly the same place. You've just got a slightly different set of formulas and a slightly different set of hypotheses, Okay. so, Oh, you can't see that. Let's try that again. Okay, So you're going to do the same thing, right? First step is going to be write an appropriate null and alternative hypotheses. So for one population, you could say the mean is equal to six. If I'm comparing two populations, though, it's almost always equal to zero, And in fact, in this paper you'll never see it not equal to zero, Because the baseline question is: is there a difference between these two populations? If that's your question. is there's a difference? You're asking yourself. well, is mu one minus mu two equal to zero or not? There's potentially some very rare scenarios where you might say: is the difference equal to five? I've never seen it. to be honest, In all the times I've been doing stuff, I've never seen that being something that people are particularly interested in. So it's always, almost always: is that equal to zero or not? So one population, two populations, exactly the same, just a slightly set of different hypotheses. So before we had sample mean, sample standard deviation, number of observations, The test statistic was x-bar minus mu over s, over the square root of n. And what is the idea of this test statistic? right, It's roughly saying how far away is the sample mean from the observed mean? All right, so that's x-bar minus mu. How far away is the sample mean from the observed mean? And then we divide by the standard error to standardize it in some sense. So taking a step back, right? The fundamental idea we're asking ourselves is this: Is the sample mean too far away from the null hypothesized value? So one population was. is the sample mean too far away from the hypothesized mean? If I'm comparing two populations, a hypothesis is not about a single population mean. It's about the difference between two population means. So the analogous question is: is the difference between the two sample means close to zero or is it too far away from zero? Right, If the difference between the two sample means is too far away from zero, then the idea is how we should reject the null hypothesis, okay, So the question really is: what's too far away? So that's what the test statistic does. So one population- we had this x-bar minus mu or mu naught, divided by the standard error. okay, I think we kind of talked about this in the past, but, roughly speaking, in sort of words, what is that asking you? it's saying what's the observed mean minus the hypothesized mean divided by the standard error of the mean. So it's just going to say how far away is the observed mean from the hypothesized mean? okay, When I'm comparing two populations, what's the difference? Well, for starters, for starters, I'll have two sample means, two sample standard deviations and two population sizes, right From the first group. first population: I'll have my sample mean standard deviation of those, how spread out those values are and how many observations I have. Second population: I'll have sample mean, sample standard deviation and how many animals I had in that second group. okay, So before we had observed mean minus hypothesized mean, divided by the standard error of the observed mean, What we have now is essentially the same thing with one addition. So before we had observed mean minus hypothesized mean, What we're focusing on now is not just a single mean, but the difference between the two means. So what should we look at? We should look at the observed difference between the two means, subtract the hypothesized difference between the two means and then divide by the standard error of the difference between the means. So a test statistic: x1 bar minus x2 bar, that's going to be the observed difference in the means or the difference in the sample means. that's what we observed. We'll subtract the hypothesized difference. Well, that's easy, because that's just zero. The null hypothesis is that the mean is zero And we need to divide this by some sort of standard error. So the standard error in the past for one population used standard deviation and n. We've got two standard deviations and two n, so we're expecting to use both of them. Okay, And that's what we'll do. So the next question is: what is the standard error that we need in this calculation? Okay, So the formula that we're going to use is the square root of s1 squared over n1 plus s2 squared over n2.. So s1, s2, they're the sample standard deviations from each of our two groups: n1, n2, number of observations for each of our two groups. It might look weird. You're sort of hoping for something that looks similar to that or analogous to that. It is, if you just sort of think about it in the right way. So s over the square root of n. if I put this under one square root, that's going to be the square root of s squared divided by n. because where the square root function works is the square root of everything, is the square root of the top divided by the square root of the bottom. So the square root of s squared is s. So this is actually the square root of s squared over n. So if I've got two population means, what am I looking at? You're looking at s1 squared over n1 plus s2 squared over n2.. I would like to very much emphasize that this is not the same as s1 over the square root of n1 plus s2 over the square root of n2.. It's not the same as that. That is incorrect. It's the same basically. So if you've done enough algebra you'll know a plus b, all squared is a squared plus b squared plus 2ab, not just a squared plus b squared. So same reasoning: the square root of this thing is not just the individual bits square rooted, because that's not how square and square root works. So this is what we're supposed to use here. So basically it is just adding the two standard deviations or the two standard errors together, but sort of adding them together in a slightly different way: s1 squared over n1 plus s2 squared over n2, and then the square root. So on some level- so far not really that different, right? You've got a slightly different formula for the standard error Test statistic. more or less the same thing. one mean, difference of two means, fine, whatever. So when we did this for one population we needed the t distribution with n minus one degrees of freedom. We're going to do the same thing here, right? To calculate our p-value we're going to need the t distribution. and the question is, what's the degrees of freedom? right? Because now I've got two sample sizes, I've got n1 and n2, so I can't just use n minus one. What goes into here? The answer to that is sort of unfortunately not that straightforward. So, roughly speaking, there's two main approaches for doing this. there's two main choices. One of them is really easy, okay. It sort of says: look at your two sample sizes, n1 and n2,, take the smaller one of them and subtract one. Take the smaller of the two sample sizes and subtract one, and that's what this first one is. If you're uncomfortable with that and you think that's too easy, you can use this option. All right, you could take s1 squared over n1 plus s2 squared over n2, square that and then- I'm not saying the rest- and divide by that. Both of these will be fine in this paper. okay, If you want to use either of these two approaches, they will both be acceptable. okay, I strongly recommend you use the first one, because you know, take the smaller of the two, subtract one. That seems pretty easy. This formula looks like a pain. We don't really want to use that Question. Is it the smallest of the two number of observations or It's the small of the two number of observations? And that's the degrees of freedom we'll use, Which actually will give you the same thing as what you said, But that's the easy way to think about it. Okay, So Excel- well, we'll see soon. Okay. So which should you choose? Like I said, choose the easy one, because the hard one is hard. And just to give you some idea, I know a lot of maths and stats formulas in my head. Even I don't know this one off the top of my head. It sort of gives you some idea of how often it's used, which is not that often. So use the easy one, Much easier, Okay. Does anyone have any other questions so far? Okay, So you know, we've kind of thrown a lot of you in the last 15 minutes or so, So what I'm going to do is slowly work through that whole process for two different examples. All right, So we'll work through it And then hopefully by the end of it, you'll be like: oh okay, Wasn't actually that bad If you understood hypothesis testing or you're reasonably comfortable with it from before the break. it's not fundamentally that different. now. It's all of the same ideas. It's okay. So let's do this. Okay, So here is my example, first example that we're going to be working through. So remember, this is the cake data set, because this is cake the food, not cake the dog. Very, very different things, Though actually right now in my house there is cake the food and cake the dog. Hopefully, cake the dog does not eat cake. the food, Anyway, That's not relevant to anything. We've got cake recipe one, cake recipe two, And the question is: is the average break angle for recipe one different or the same or whatever, to recipe two? Is there a difference between these two recipes? In particular, is there a difference between the break angles for these two recipes? So now, hypothesis: mu one minus mu two is equal to zero. alternative hypothesis: mu one minus mu two: not equal to zero. So mu one is the average break angle of recipe. That's not how you spell recipe. That's not how you spell recipe. It's probably something like that. That's fine, That's fine. Yeah, Good, I got it right. Just yeah, Mu two is the average recipe breaking angle of recipe two. So that's my null and alternative hypothesis. So step one: same null. alternative hypothesis. Step two: calculate the test statistic, All right. So what do I need? I need x one bar minus x two bar And I'm going to need the standard error, s one squared over n one and s two squared over n two. So what I need are actually descriptive statistics for these break angles, for these two different recipes. So let me go: data, data analysis, descriptive statistics. So I want all the break angles from recipe one. I'm going to want summary statistics and I'm going to put the output range here, Okay, Okay. So these are the summary statistics. mean standard deviation, so forth, for recipe one. Do the same thing for recipe two. So first thing we I'm going to do, let's write down what the standard error is. So the standard error is the square root of n two. So first thing we I'm going to do, let's write down what the standard error is. So the standard error is the square root of s one squared over n one plus s two squared over n two. So this is here's our first recipe, recipe one. So the standard deviation is 7.49, so it's going to be 7.49 squared divided by the number of observations in the first group, which is 90.. The standard deviation of recipe two: 8.40, that squared divided by the number of observations in that group, which in this case is also 90, the number of observations down there. I should say, if I'm going too fast you need to yell out, otherwise I will just keep chugging along. Okay, so that's my standard error. The other way you could do this is, if you remember, variance is just standard deviation squared. So 7.49056 squared is actually just there already. it's 56.10849.. So you could use those numbers directly instead of picking the smaller number squared. but you know, same thing, Okay. so my standard error is going to be: if I work this out, it's going to be the square root of that standard deviation squared divided by that number plus that standard deviation squared divided by that number there- So that's my standard error- Comes out to about 1.186.. So I'll get the formula. that's my standard error. So my test statistic is x1 bar minus x2 bar divided by the standard error. So 33.12 minus 33.64, divided by 1.186.. So just the mean of the first one minus the mean of the second one divided by the standard error. So the test statistic is going to be that minus that, divided by that Test statistic, 1.2459.. 1.2459.. So some of you might be wondering: does it matter if I take recipe 1 minus recipe 2, or recipe 2 minus recipe 1?? The answer is not really. I mean you'll get something different, but not really. If I took x2 bar minus x1 bar, if I took recipe 2 minus recipe 1, instead of 1.246, I would get negative 1.246. Which actually won't matter when you calculate the p-value, Because the p-value is the probability of the test statistic, or more extreme If it's a positive number. more extreme than that is everything bigger than it. If it was a negative number, it would be everything less than it, and you'd get the same answer for the p-value at the end. So here I'm going to use the t-distribution. I'm going to say: well, I observed 1.246,. so what's the problem? More extreme than that is bigger than 1.246.. I just need to know the degrees of freedom. So I've got 90, and I have 90. So I need to choose the smaller of those two numbers, which is not tricky, is 90. And subtract 1.. So I'll use the t-distribution with 89 degrees of freedom, Degrees of freedom: 89, endpoint: 1.2459.. So the probability of being bigger than that is 0.108.. And if I multiply that by 2, it sort of does that for me. The two-tailed p-value is 0.216.. All right, so I made it to a p-value. The interpretation of the p-value is exactly the same. Oh, question, Oh, that one. Yep, Thank you. I did do it right in Excel though. Yeah, The rest of those numbers should be right. Yeah, So I've got my p-value of 0.216.. So the p-value is bigger than 0.05, so we do not reject null hypothesis. In particular, the null hypothesis is that the means are the same. I'm going to not reject null hypothesis. I'm going to not reject that null hypothesis, Okay. Any other questions about that? Oh, So I just start typing t-distribution and it comes up t-distribution probabilities. That's what I click on. Yep, Any other questions? Okay, So in a sense, the conclusion is: I've looked at these two recipes. My null hypothesis is there's no difference between the average break angles, And I didn't reject that null hypothesis. So sort of the idea is: we haven't found any evidence to suggest there's a difference between those two things. all right, We concluded that they might be the same. So which sort of kind of checks out? like your sample means were pretty close: 33, 31.6.. They're pretty close. You'd be like, yeah, they're probably not that different. Can we quantify that some way? That's what the hypothesis test does. So n1 is 90, and n2 is 90. So the minimum of n1 minus 1 and n2 minus 1 is the minimum of 89 and 89, which is 89. And so then we just stick it in there. We're about to do that. Any other questions? Any other questions? Okay, Right, Okay, So we'll do the whole thing. same thing again. Different context, different data set. see how it works. Slightly different scenario, Okay. What have we got? So, hopefully, Well, at least this might be slightly familiar. This is data that we looked at in lecture three or four or both, I can't remember. What it is is the only objective way to measure the value of any child, right, Um, the value of any child is measured only in their ability to do maths. Other stuff, who cares? So what we've got is a bunch of maths test scores, and we've got it for a bunch of private schools and a bunch of public schools. So we've got some private data, and there's a lot more public school students than private school students, because you know, that's just generally how this tends to work. And so we've got maths test scores, and so we've got maths test scores for the public school. and really the question is: is there any advantage in sending your kid to private school compared to public school? And when we really say, is there any advantage, like I said, the only thing we actually care about is: will they be better at maths if they go to a public school compared to a private school, or the other way around, right? Is there any difference between the two? Okay, so what we're going to do is sort of formally test this hypothesis now. So I've got my null hypotheses: mu1 minus mu2 is equal to zero. mu1 minus mu2 is not equal to zero. So mu1 is the average maths score from public school And mu2 is going to be your average score from a private school. Okay, so we're going to test this hypothesis. what are we going to need? We're going to need x1 bar s1 and n1, and we'll need x2 bar s2 and n2.. We'll do some descriptive statistics: private school scores, all of those ones. Okay, Now I want all the public school scores. Store that over here. Okay, All right. So I've got my private school scores and my public school scores. So for my private school, mu2 is the private school. So the private school is 54.75.. The standard deviation is 8.88 and the number of observations is 32.. For the public schools, the sample mean is 52.24.. Standard deviation is 9.43.. And I have 168 observations now. So the standard error is: what was it? The form is s1 squared over n1 plus s2 squared over n2.. So 9.43 squared over 168 plus 8.88 squared over 32.. So let's work that out: Squirt of 8.82 squared divided by 32 plus 9.43 squared divided by 168.. So 1.73.. Okay, So my test statistic is going to be 52.24 minus 54.75, 1.73 over 1.73.. All right, Take the difference between the two observed sample means and divide by the standard error. So the test statistic is going to be that number minus that number divided by that number. So my p-value, I've got my test statistic. So my p-value, I've got my test statistic. What's the probability of that or more extreme? So it's going to be 2 times the probability, t-distribution: 1.448.. More extreme is everything bigger than it. And the only fiddly thing is the last thing we need is how many degrees of freedom do we have? So one group has 168.. The other group has 32.. The easy rule is: take the smaller of the two numbers and subtract 1.. 32 is less than 168.. So I just take that one and I subtract 1.. So I'm going to use 31 degrees of freedom And 1.488,, well, 1.448.. The probability of being bigger than that is 0.078.. Multiplied by 2, for me it's 0.1577.. Okay, so again, the p-value in this scenario is bigger than 0.05.. So we do not reject the null hypothesis, In particular that the mean math scores are the same. So what is the moral of this story? The moral of this story at least, is: if you're planning to have children in the future, don't bother with private school. Their math scores are more or less the same. just a waste of time, Might as well. just send them to the one that's free, Because their math score is not going to be that different And that's the only thing that we should be actually caring about. right, Their ability to do maths. Okay, Any other questions? Okay, Oh, yep, So S1 is the standard deviation from the first population, Yes, And N1 is the number of observations from the first population. So for the private population, S1 is 8.82.. And N1 is 32.. And then S2 is the standard deviation from the second population And N2 is 168.. Any other questions? Any other questions? Okay, so we're going to do one more thing before you go. You can't go yet. You might ask yourself the question: this seems like a really useful thing to be able to do. Will Excel do this for me automatically? The answer is yes, All right Now. we did confidence intervals on hypothesis testing in one population, And Excel will not do that automatically for you, because Excel is a piece of software. That's right, It's a piece of software, But let's see. So if we click on data analysis- Yeah, I'm going to see that- I'll go ahead and see you. So if you scroll down a bit, there's a bit that says t tests to sample, And there's a few options. There's t tests paired to sample for means: t-test, colon- two sample assuming equal variances, unequal variances. z-test- two sample, four means: okay, what we have just gone through is this one here: t-test- two sample assuming unequal variances. okay, on monday next week we'll actually go through this other scenario here and then on thursday we'll go through this third scenario. okay, but what we've just done is the t-test two samples assuming unequal variances. i would also like to point out: no one calls it that except excel. all right, i can show you. everybody calls this the two sample t-test, because what we've done is we've done a t-test on two samples. no one calls it t-test two sample. and to prove this to you, what do they write? t-test, two sample. okay, if you, if you type that into google, the first hit is called the two sample t-test, two sample t-test. what is a two sample? no one calls it t-test two sample, because that's not what it's called, except if your name is microsoft excel. i hate you, excel, you are the worst anyway. fine, uh, if we do t-test two sample, okay, all right. uh, it asks for variable one and variable two. so, all right, we'll take the private math scores, variable two probably wants all the public math scores. that's good, like. so excel is not smart enough to know the default hypothesized mean difference is almost always zero. okay, fine, um, let's just put the output here, shall we? okay? so what we've got? we've got, it says two sample t-test, we've got the means, the standard deviations and the number of observations. so what they've quite actually, usefully, for once, they've written down exactly the information you need. if you notice, it's exactly the same as those values that i wrote down, the numbers that we actually use, we need. that's what excels listed there. at least it should be the same numbers. oh, well, okay, they use the um variance, which is s1 squared the squared values of it, but otherwise the numbers are the same and the means are the same. hypothesize means zero degrees of freedom. they use 45, uh, excel uses the complicated formula, okay, um, because it it likes being difficult. um, in practice it will make basically no difference, right, and so we can see this here. so they used uh, 45 degrees of freedom, okay. and then you'd be like: so what is the p-value? and then you'd read this and be like: why do you have such stupid labels for everything. okay, we want two tail, so that means it's a two-sided hypothesis test. so not equals to p, t less than equal to t, i don't know, whatever. yeah, that's the p-value, okay, it's. it's just labeled atrociously, atrociously, but fine. so 0.141545, we got 0.1577. okay, so if you use a slightly different degrees of freedom, you get a slightly different answer, but it basically makes no difference. right? it's sort of it's changed so slightly and remember, we're just primarily focusing on: is it bigger than 0.05 or less than 0.05? 0.1577 or 0.1545, basically the same thing. okay, so, to be fair, it's not the worst thing excel's ever done, like it will actually do the two sample t-tests for you. you just click the right thing and select the right options, okay, um, that'll do for this week, i think, unless there's any other questions. nope, all right, we'll pick it up from here on. um, what's it, dave? monday?
