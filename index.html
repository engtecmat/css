                    <h2 id="first-section"><i>Definition of Value.</i></h2>
                    <p>
                        A clear conception of the meaning of the term <i>value</i> is the first essential to a discussion of the subject of money.

                    <p>
                        Under the general term <i>value</i> the older economists recognized two distinct conceptions, which they distinguished as <i>value</i> in <i>use</i> and <i>value in exchange</i>.
                    <p>
                        To the former they gave little attention, merely stating that while it
                        was essential to value in exchange, the latter was not proportional
                        to nor determined by the former, and citing air and water as familiar
                        examples of objects having great utility, or use value, yet having
                        little or no exchange value.

                    <p>
                        Modern economists--chiefly those of the Austrian school--have analyzed
                        the subject more thoroughly, especially the relation between the two
                        conceptions, and have shown that utility or subjective value, as it is
                        generally termed by them, is an expression both of human desire and
                        of the quantity of the necessary commodity available to satisfy such
                        desire.

                    <p>
                        The utility of a thing grows less as the quantity of it increases, and
                        it is the utility of the last increment of supply, or the marginal
                        utility, that determines the subjective value of the whole supply,
                        and it is the ratios between these subjective values that determine
                        exchange values. Air and water, for instance, have no great utility,
                        as viewed by the older economists, except where the supply is limited;
                        ordinarily, their abundance makes their utility, or use value, small.

                    <p>
                        It is not essential to the purpose of this work to enter into an
                        abstract discussion of the theory of value further than is necessary
                        to make clear the fact that the present analysis in no way lessens
                        or invalidates the distinction between the two conceptions of value
                        noted by the earlier economists,--a fact which has been overlooked by
                        some who have accepted the marginal utility theory. The distinction
                        remains, broad and clear. The one conception, whether called "value in
                        use," "marginal utility," or "subjective value," pertains wholly to the
                        relation which a single good, or unit group of goods, bears to a single
                        individual, or society unit, in respect to human well-being, and has no
                        reference or relation to any other individual or other good.

                    <p>
                        The other conception, called "objective value," or "exchange value,"
                        is dual in its nature, involving in all cases two or more commodities.
                        Abstractly, it is _the ratio at which commodities may be exchanged
                        for each other_, or, since such ratio for a unit of one commodity is
                        expressed by the amount of another given for it, the exchange value
                        of a thing is the quantity of some other thing that will be evenly
                        exchanged for it, or, considered in a general sense, the amount of
                        commodities in general it will exchange for,--_its general purchasing
                        power_, in short.

                    <p>
                        This latter conception--exchange value--is the one that principally
                        concerns us in discussing the subject of money. It is also the
                        conception generally in mind when the simple term _value_ is used
                        either by economists or by the general public, and wherever the term is
                        used in this work without qualification it is to be understood in that
                        sense.

                    <p>
                        The Austrian economist, E. von Böhm-Bawerk, says, in his "Positive
                        Theory of Capital," p. 130:--

                    <p>
                        "Value in the subjective sense is the importance which a good, or
                        a complex of goods, possesses with regard to the well-being of a
                        subject."

                    <p>
                        "Besides the expression 'value in exchange,' English economists
                        use, quite indifferently, the expression 'purchasing power,' and we
                        Germans are beginning in the same way to put in general use the term
                        _Tauschkraft_."

                    <p>
                        The value of a thing may be considered either in a particular sense,
                        with reference to some other specified thing, or it may be considered
                        in a general sense, with reference to all other things considered as
                        a whole. We may say the value of a bushel of wheat is two bushels of
                        corn, meaning that these two commodities exchange for each other in
                        that ratio; or we may speak of the value of wheat having risen or
                        fallen, meaning that its general purchasing power, or the ratio between
                        that and all other things taken as a unit or a whole, has increased or
                        decreased.

                    <p>
                        The term must invariably be used or considered in a general sense,
                        unless otherwise specifically stated, for we must always have some
                        other thing in mind besides the one whose value we are considering;
                        while if no other is stated, commodities in general (taken as a whole)
                        is that thing.

                    <p>
                        Value being a ratio, it is impossible for all values to rise or
                        fall simultaneously. The sum of subjective values may increase or
                        decrease,--indeed it is one of the great objects of human endeavour to
                        increase the sum of want-satisfying power,--but the sum of the ratios
                        between these subjective values is constant. As one term of any ratio
                        rises relative to the other, the second necessarily falls as regards
                        the first.

                    <p>
                        This principle is so universally recognized that quotations might be
                        given from almost every work on political economy in support of it. The
                        following will be sufficient, however, as regards both the definition
                        of value and this principle.

                    <p>
                        John Stuart Mill says, in his "Principles of Political Economy":--

                    <p>
                        "Value is a relative term. The value of a thing means the quantity of
                        some other thing, or of things in general, which it exchanges for. The
                        values of all things can never, therefore, rise or fall simultaneously.
                        There is no such thing as a general rise or a general fall of values.
                        Every rise of value supposes a fall, and every fall a rise."

                    <p>

                        Again, he says:--

                    <p>
                        "Things which are exchanged for one another can no more all fall, or
                        all rise, than a dozen runners can each outstrip all the rest, or a
                        hundred trees all overtop one another."

                    <p>
                        Prof. S. N. Patten says, in "Dynamic Economics," p. 64: "Objective
                        values, however, are never a sum, but only a relation between
                        subjective values. There can never be high or low objective values
                        of commodities as a whole. It is therefore impossible to add to or
                        subtract from them."

                    <p>
                        This latter quotation, as well as the preceding one from von
                        Böhm-Bawerk,--both exponents of the marginal utility theory,--may help
                        to correct a quite prevalent impression that this later theory does not
                        distinguish between the two conceptions of value, and that because the
                        sum of subjective values may increase, the sum of objective or exchange
                        values can increase also.

                    <h2 id="second-section"><i>Supply and Demand.</i></h2>

                    <p>
                        All economists recognize the fact that the immediate determiner of
                        value is the relation between supply and demand. These terms in their
                        economic sense mean something more than mere desire and mere quantity.
                        <i>Supply</i> means the amount offered in exchange, and <i>demand</i> means not
                        only a desire, but a desire coupled with the ability and willingness to
                        give other commodities in exchange for the one wanted.

                    <p>
                        In this sense the terms are strictly correlative. The supply of a
                        commodity (that is, the amount offered) may be considered as equivalent
                        to a demand for some other commodity, or for commodities in general.
                        We may say, then, that the value of any commodity is determined by
                        the ratio that the demand for that commodity bears to its supply; or
                        by the ratio that the demand for that commodity bears to the demand
                        for some other commodity,--or commodities in general, when the term
                        <i>value</i> is used in a general sense and not with reference to some other
                        specified thing only. (The objection that has been made by some writers
                        that a ratio could not logically exist between a desire [demand] and
                        a quantity [supply], does not apply to these terms in their economic
                        sense; for, as above stated, they are something more than a mere desire
                        and a mere quantity, and the expression is translatable into the other
                        expression, "ratio between the demand for one commodity and the demand
                        for others in general.")

                    <p>
                        The statement of the later economists that exchange value depends
                        on, and is determined by, the ratio between subjective values in no
                        way conflicts with the above statement that value is determined by
                        the ratio between demand and supply, for the demand for a commodity
                        is determined by its subjective value and by that alone, and must
                        vary with it. Hence, as the quantity of anything increases and its
                        subjective value lessens, the demand for it relative to the quantity of
                        other articles also lessens, and its value falls, and <i>vice versa</i>.

                    <p>
                        This close connection between value and the ratio between demand and
                        supply--value rising as the ratio increases, and falling as it grows
                        less--is true in all cases. No other factor can affect the value of any
                        commodity except by altering the relation or ratio between these two.

                    <p>
                        Cost of production is a more remote factor that enters into the
                        determination of value in most but not in all cases, through its
                        effect on supply. It is used, like the term <i>value</i>, in two senses,
                        a subjective and an objective sense. In the former it means the pain
                        of labour and waiting that must be undergone to produce the good that
                        is being considered,--the negative pleasure given to get the positive
                        pleasure to be derived from that good. In its objective sense--the
                        sense in which it is generally used--cost of production means the
                        goods that must otherwise be given for, bartered or set against those
                        desired; in a simple case of direct production, it means the goods that
                        might have been produced, in lieu of those that have been produced,
                        with the same subjective cost; in more complex cases, it means the sum
                        of the goods sacrificed, in the shape of raw materials, rent, wages,
                        interest, etc., to get the one produced.

                    <p>
                        When the value of a commodity falls to or below the cost of production,
                        or even when it approaches it so closely as to reduce the margin
                        between the two--the producer's profit--below that in other industries,
                        then, men will cease to produce the one and turn their labour and
                        capital to producing the others which offer greater profit, thus
                        lowering the supply of the abandoned product and raising that of the
                        more profitable, thereby affecting the value of both.

                    <p>
                        The effect of this operation of the law of cost is to equalize profits
                        and make the values of things conform to their cost or be proportional
                        thereto.

                    <p>
                        The law can only operate when men are free to turn their labour from
                        one industry to another. Hence arises the important exception to the
                        law, that the values of goods produced by a monopoly are not affected
                        by their cost of production. Only under free competition does the law
                        operate in full force. As monopoly becomes a factor cost ceases to be,
                        and, when the monopoly is complete, cost has no weight whatever in the
                        determination of value.

                    <p>
                        For analogous reasons, cost enters but partially into the determination
                        of the value of such goods as are dependent more or less on luck or
                        chance for their production, as in the case of precious stones, gold,
                        silver, etc.

                    <p>

                    <h2 id="third-section"><i>The Standard of Value.</i></h2>

                    <p>
                        We may use the value of anything as a measure by which to compare
                        the values of any and all other things, but as all the factors that
                        determine value are variable, the value of everything is variable. Any
                        value may rise with reference to some other value, and at the same time
                        fall with reference to a third.

                    <p>
                        By what standard, or invariable measure at all times and places, can we
                        compare the values of goods to determine their constancy or variability?

                    <p>
                        We must not forget that there are two kinds of value, and that it is a
                        standard of exchange value we are seeking. So far as it may be possible
                        to formulate a standard of subjective value, it must consist of the
                        pain or inutility of labour; for this kind of value pertains only to a
                        single good, and cannot be referred to other goods without confusing
                        it with the other conception. We cannot measure the absolute pleasure
                        a good will give to an individual except by the pain he will undergo
                        to get it. It is not a standard for this sort of value we want. It was
                        evidently some such conception as the above--confusing, however, not
                        only the two kinds of value but the two descriptions of labour--that
                        led Adam Smith to consider labour as the ultimate standard of value. He
                        appears also to have confused the idea of a standard of value with that
                        of a determiner of value.

                    <p>
                        These errors were pointed out in part by Ricardo and, in part also,
                        by J. S. Mill and later writers; hence the contention that labour is
                        in any way a standard of value has long been abandoned by the ablest
                        economists. The idea still lingers, however, and is frequently brought
                        forward in current discussions, and for this reason it seems necessary
                        to analyze briefly the relation of labour to value.

                    <p>
                        Labour is necessary to the production of all commodities, but it is
                        not itself a commodity, nor anything which for itself is desired. It
                        is a force, and, like every force, valuable according to the results
                        it accomplishes. If unproductive, it has no value; if productive, its
                        value varies according to the value of the commodities or utilities
                        it creates. We use the terms "price of labour" or "value of labour,"
                        implying that it is the labour which is valued, and which is bought and
                        sold; but the terms are merely a convenience. What is really bought
                        and sold is the commodity or utility such labour has produced or will
                        produce. If it were the labour itself, then the purchaser would receive
                        not only the labour, but the commodity it produced, in exchange for the
                        wages paid,--a double return,--which, of course, is absurd.

                    <p>
                        Three descriptions of labour may be distinguished in connection with
                        the value of a commodity, viz.:--

                    <p>
                        (1) The labour expended in its production.

                    <p>
                        (2) The labour in general it will purchase.

                    <p>
                        (3) The labour necessary to produce more of it.

                    <p>
                        The first kind of labour in no way affects the existing supply or
                        demand of the commodity, and is neither a measure of its value nor
                        a regulator or determining factor of such value. Evidences are not
                        lacking to prove that a commodity will frequently not exchange for as
                        much labour as was expended in producing it.

                    <p>
                        The second kind of labour, the amount in general which a commodity
                        will purchase, depends on the amount of commodities such labour will
                        produce, less the share which goes to capital as its reward; for,
                        neglecting rent or classing it with capital, these two, labour and
                        capital, are joint factors in production and divide between them
                        the total product. It is hardly necessary to observe that labour is
                        continually growing more efficient; that improved skill and methods
                        enable a much larger amount of commodities in general to be produced,
                        with a certain amount of labour, than could formerly be produced; and
                        that labour receives, as its share of such product, a much larger
                        amount than formerly.

                    <p>
                        It is thus evident, that a commodity which would exchange for the same
                        amount of labour now as formerly, would exchange for a much larger
                        amount of commodities in general now than then, and, if we adhere to
                        our definition of exchange value, would be worth <i>more</i> than formerly;
                        while if labour be taken as a standard of value, it would be worth
                        the <i>same</i>. The use of this form of labour as a standard of value is,
                        it will be seen, incompatible with the definition of value. It may
                        serve as a measure of the relative values of two commodities at any
                        particular time and place, just as any third commodity may; but, as
                        Ricardo remarks, "is subject to as many fluctuations as the commodities
                        compared with it."

                    <p>
                        The same argument applies to the third form of labour--that necessary
                        to produce more of a commodity. This form of labour, however, is one of
                        the factors in the cost of production, and through its effect on cost
                        is one of the more remote factors that determine value, as explained in
                        considering cost of production, but this does not make it in any sense
                        a standard.

                    <p>
                        We may conclude, then, that labour in any form is not a standard of
                        value; that, as John Stuart Mill observes, it "discards the idea of
                        exchange value altogether, substituting a totally different idea, more
                        analogous to value in use."

                    <p>
                        Since the values of things can never rise or fall simultaneously,
                        every rise supposing a fall, and every fall a rise, it follows that
                        the values of all taken together must be constant; in other words,
                        that general values cannot change. Thus it is that we find whether
                        any one thing has risen or fallen in value, as between one period
                        and another, only by comparing it with all others,--in short, by its
                        general exchange or purchasing power. If this has increased, then its
                        value has risen; if it has decreased, its value has fallen. It is
                        evidently not necessary that anything should exchange for more or less
                        of <i>every</i> other thing to show a rise or fall of value, but only that
                        it should, on the average, exchange for more or less of all; that its
                        average purchasing power should be greater or less. If it has exchanged
                        at different times for the same amounts, on the average, of all other
                        things, its value, clearly, has remained constant.

                    <p>
                        This is the only standard, or test, which can be applied to the
                        exchange value of any commodity to determine its constancy or
                        variability, and it is inherent in the very definition of exchange
                        value.

                    <p>
                        The values of commodities may be compared to the surface of the
                        ocean, which, vexed by winds and tides, is never at rest, every point
                        continually rising or falling as compared with others. As some points
                        rise others fall, yet there is a mean level which does not vary, and by
                        comparison with which the variations of level of any particular point
                        may be determined. So with values, there is a mean or average which is
                        constant, and by referring individual values to that we can determine
                        their fluctuations.

                    <p>
                        These ideas will become clearer as we proceed to apply them concretely
                        to the special case of money.

                    <p>
                        Although there can be but one real <i>standard of value</i>, invariable at
                        all times and places, yet, as before stated, any commodity may serve as
                        a <i>measure of value</i>, and the great convenience subserved, by all the
                        people of any locality or country using the same commodity instead of a
                        number of different ones for this purpose, early led to the adoption of
                        some one commodity in each locality as a "money" to measure values and
                        facilitate exchanges.
