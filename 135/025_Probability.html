<h1>025 Probability</h1>
<p>
    Okay, your marks for test two are on Moodle now. If you can't access them, you can't see them. send me an e-mail, or if you have any questions regarding marks, you can just send an e-mail to Tim. okay, I've also uploaded Marker's comments on assignment seven. I think it's good if you can just read them. I read them and I realized that a lot of you have got the matrix question wrong. You have to understand if you load the question on chat GPT, it doesn't give you the right answer most of the time. It's not good with matrix: it doesn't give you the right answer always. So I would recommend that try it on your end first and then put that on chat GPT, because most of you have got that wrong. okay, Same with assignment eight as well, because we have matrix question in assignment eight as well. right, And also in your tests and exams you will not have chat GPT. I don't mind if you want to use video. Marker was not happy about it with the comments. Yeah, Okay, Let's start with conditional probability. We discussed conditional probability in the last lecture. conditional probability states that probability of A given there is another, even B, is equal to what? What is the formula? What is A given B. What is the probability of A given B, probability of A intersect B over probability of B, right? So we've solved a few questions. This is the last question, which covers almost all the concepts up to conditional probability. We have probability of A- B and probability of A union B. Can you find probability of A intersection B? First of all, what rule do we use to find the probability of A intersection B? How do we find it? Which rule? Addition, Addition: Probability of A union B is equal to probability of A plus probability of B minus probability of A intersection B, right? So we have to find this. We know probability of A union B is A plus, B minus. probability of A intersection B. We don't have this term. Probability of A is 0.6.. I can move that here, right? Probability of A is 0.6 plus. probability of B is 0.5 minus. probability of A union B is 0.5.. That is 0.8.. That is 0.1 plus 0.8 plus 0.3, right? The second part is probability of A given B complement. I want you to solve this. You can also write it as probability of A given B complement. Same thing, right? Try solving this question. It is a conditional probability question. How do we know that We have to find the probability of one event given another event has occurred, right? So that's a conditional probability question. Try solving this question. It's not very straightforward because you're dealing with B complement here, right? So you have to perform certain operations before applying conditional probability. Remember, you will not be provided what concept to use or what formula to use, So you have to understand what to do in a particular question. So you need practice. You have to also have a pattern based on what tuner practice which really shows you how to smartphone衛 xem what煮. If I have to open this in a formula, what do I write? It's a conditional probability concept, right? What do I write here? Probability of A given B. is probability of A intersection B over probability of B, correct? So what is probability of A given B complement? Just like B, B complement is also an even correct. So what do I write here? Probability of? Yeah? So if I just have to write it in this form first, how do I write it? A intersection B complement over probability of what B complement? Because we're dealing with B complement even here. Now we don't have A intersection B complement. We have A intersection B complement. We have A intersection B. Now. if you think from a Venn diagram perspective you're talking about. if that is A and that is B. I'm saying whatever probability of A and not B. So not this part, just this shaded region, correct? So can I say: probability of A minus probability of A intersection B, Right, And what is probability of B complement? We don't have B complement, We have probability of B though. So what do I do in the denominator here? Yes, One minus probability of B. Now we have all these terms correct. So we can find the probability Probability of A is 0.6, minus probability of A intersection B is 0.3.. You've just calculated this Over one minus probability of B: B is 0.5.. So one minus probability of B is also 0.5. Right, So that is 0.3 over 0.5.. Now, if you don't, your calculator is not allowed in your test or exam, right, So you can just leave it to this point, It's fine. Okay, If it's a simple calculation, you can do it, But if it's division, you don't want to do it, It's fine, Okay. Are A and B independent? How do we check if two events are independent or not? How do we check if A and B are independent events? Sorry, I can't hear you. Multiplication, Multiplication of what Like? when you multiply the probability of A with probability of B. Exactly, If we multiply probability of A with probability of B, it should be equal to probability of A intersection B for A and B to be independent events, correct? What is probability of A multiplied by probability of B? 0.6 multiplied by 0.5?, 0.3? And what is probability of A intersection B? Again 0.3.. This means this condition holds in your question: Probability of A times probability of B is equal to the probability of A intersection B. Therefore A and B are independent events. If they were not equal to each other, then they're not independent events. Okay, Now if you have, probability of A given B is equal to probability of A intersection B over probability of B. if I just move this here, we're basically saying probability of A intersection B is equal to probability of A given B multiplied by probability of B, Correct? We're just moving that around. That is a multiplication rule, Correct? Now if suppose I, instead of A given B, I have probability of B given A, In that case my formula is: probability of B intersection A over probability of A, Correct? So by multiplication rule, I'm saying probability of B intersection A is equal to probability of B given A multiplied by probability of A, And I move that here. Remember this. and this is basically the same thing, Correct, That is the same, but obviously depends upon the condition here. Your right-hand side is different, But that's a multiplication rule. Okay, Let's talk about law of probability. Please read the question first. Okay, Please read the question first. Okay. Now, in this question, what are we trying to find? Now we're saying that Jeff will probably drink three, four, five or six beers, equally likely if partner accompanies him. else he will drink five, six, seven or eight beers. We don't know whether the partner accompanies him or not, for the party or whatever. Now the question is: how many beers do you think Jeff is going to drink? Let's talk about events first. Let's say A is the event that his partner accompanies him. Okay, Then what is A complement? What is A complement? What is A complement? Yeah, Right Now, if I want to-. At this point we're saying that he will probably drink these number of beers if we have an event A, or these number of beers if we do not have the event A, correct. But we want to find the overall probability of, say, Jeff will drink K number of beers, right, If I'm saying what is the probability that he will drink three beers, given that the partner accompanies him, What will be the probability? What will be the probability? What will be the probability? What will be the probability? What will be the probability? One by four, Right? Same for four, five or six beers as well, Correct? Okay, Okay, What is the probability that he will drink eight beers, given his partner accompanies him? Zero, Zero, Zero, Poor guy. Now what is the probability that he will drink eight beers, given partner does not accompany him? One over four? Same for five, six and seven as well, correct. But if I want to know what is the probability that he will drink certain number of beers, some K beers or, let's say, three beers? Now we're just talking about overall probability. We don't know whether A event happens or not. That probability that he will drink three beers is dependent on that event, correct? that he will drink three beers is dependent on a and a complement both, correct. so let's say, h is my event that jeff drinks three beers. and now i'm concerned about that overall probability, considering event a and considering a complement even as well, right? that is where law of probability is used. so we're saying: what is the probability that jeff drinks three beers? right, that is basically the sum of probability of h intersection a plus probability of h intersection a complement. this here says: now you have two events, you have a and a complement, correct? so we're saying h intersection all the events, h is dependent on, correct? so here, how can we? can we just open this formula further? multiplication rule. remember multiplication rule? probability of a intersection b is probability of b multiplied by probability of a given b comes from conditional probability, correct? so here we are basically saying probability that jeff drinks three beers is equal to probability that he will drink three beers given partner accompanies him, multiplied by the probability that the partner is with him, plus probability that he will drink three beers, given a complement the partner does not accompany him, multiplied by probability of a complement the partner does not accompany him, so that event h is dependent on a and a complement, right? so we're taking that conditional component, component, component for both the scenarios to find an overall probability of h which is he will drink three beers, right? so what is the probability that he will drink three beers, given partner accompanies him? what is the probability one over four, multiplied by what is the probability that the partner accompanies him? what is the probability that he will drink three beers, given partner does not accompany him? a complement: what is the probability that he will drink three beers, given partner does not accompany him? what is the probability? a complement: what is the probability? 0 multiplied by 0.5 correct? that is 0.125 plus 0. that is the probability of h. probability that he will drink three beers, taking into account that partner might accompany him or might not, is 0.125 or 12.5 percent. that is law of probability. now we have ai component here, because there might be an event h which is dependent on a1, a2, a3, up to an correct, let's say, we have an event h which which is dependent on three other events. in that case, you're basically talking about probability of h intersection a1 plus probability of h intersection a2, h intersection a3. right, so events can be more than one and we can use law of probability to find an overall probability of something, given that it is dependent on some n events. okay, is that clear? let's talk about basis theorem. then. probability of a given b is probability of a intersection b. probability of b, probability of b. that is conditional probability, right, probability of b given a is what b intersection a? yeah, over probability of a. now i'm saying that this term here, b here and this is the same thing, right? we're basically saying probability of a intersection b is equal to probability of b intersection a. it's the same thing, correct? we're just talking about the same event here, right? so here, probability of a intersection b is probability of a given b multiplied by probability of b. this one, here, that one probability of b intersection a is probability of a given a multiplied by probability of a. we're just doing that. if this is same, it's basically the same. even can we say probability of a given b. so if i have to find probability of a given b, so if i have to find probability of a given b, b given i, i have these components here. i can just use this formula: you can move probability of b to the right hand side, b. does that make sense? does that make sense? is that clear? this is basis theorem. some people call it base theorem. that is just wrong. it is basis theorem. it's not based. all right, you will see it in a lot of slides. it's just wrong. okay, that is basis theorem. you're basically using the concept of conditional probability to find that sometimes you don't have intersection terms, correct? you cannot use a intersection b, you cannot use conditional probabilities sometimes. sometimes you have b given a and you have to find the opposite. you have to find a given b. in that case basis theorem is useful sometimes. probability of b is provided, sometimes not. if we know that probability of b is dependent on two events- a and a complement- then you can use law of probability to find the denominator correct. so if we have an even b, it is dependent on a and a complement. right, because we can clearly see a given b, b given a. they are dependent on these two events. if you do not have probability of b, you can just use law of probability. so probability of b given a, probability of a over. now, law of probability says probability of b is probability of b given a probability of a plus probability of b given a complement multiplied by probability of a complement. so you're just opening this and that basically is law of probability, right? this is another form of basis theorem, so depends upon what is given in the question. sometimes you've provided with probability of b. you can just put that here, sometimes not. you have to find it. so you just use law of probability to find probability of b first and then calculate what have. whatever has been asked in the question clear. all of this is linked. you have to understand conditional probability. the base of all the concepts is conditional probability. then law of probability says that to find an overall probability that is dependent on some events, you can just use that by using the formula of law of probability. and then basis theorem says if you have b given a and you have to find a given b, you can just use basis theorem to find that particular answer. so you have to read the question and see what has been asked. i will not tell you to use conditional probability or law of probability of basis theorem. you have to figure out from the question what is needed, what formula to use to find the answer. okay, can we try to solve this question now? i don't know if it's a conditional probability or law of probability of basis theorem. questions you have to figure it out. says: jeff bases his choice of clothes upon the weather forecast. if it is predicted to rain, there is a 7.7, 70 probability he will wear his blue suit. otherwise he will wear his gray suit. if it is not predicted to rain, then there is a 0.2 probability he he will wear his blue suit. otherwise he will wear his gray suit. lastly, it is predicted to rain on 30 percent of days and now, provided events, you can use r as an event to say it is predicted to rain and b be the event that jeff will wear his blue suit. first question is: write down at least four pieces of information on the probability is given below. now, for questions like these, i would suggest: write down everything that is given in the question first, otherwise you will not understand and you will feel just very confused. right first, write everything that has been given in the questions. first part says: write down at least four pieces of information on the probabilities given above. you have two minutes. if, if we are saying that jeff will wear a blue suit, that is even b. what is b complement? he is not wearing blue suit. but what other sample space do? in our sample space we only have blue and gray, right? so if b is jeff will wear his blue suit, b complement is that he will wear his gray suit or he he's not wearing blue suits. the same thing, correct, okay? so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so. so what information do i have on the question? let's start with event r. do we have probability of r? what is pr that it is predicted to rain, sorry, 0.30. can i then find probability of our complement one minus pr 0.70? what else do we have? i'm not going to solve this question now. you have to tell me. we have enough time. probability of b. probability of b given r. it says what is the probability that he will wear a blue suit, given it is predicted to rain. what is the probability? 0.7, 0.7, yeah, what else? otherwise he will wear his gray suit. how do i write that? probability of what, given what it is predicted to rain, 0.7, that he will wear a blue suit, otherwise he will wear his gray suit. how do i write it? 0.3, yes, b complement, given our probability that it is predicted to rain. given that it is predicted to rain, what is the probability that he will not wear his blue suit or he will wear his gray suit? That is 0.3, one minus the other event. What else? If it is not predicted to rain, then there is a point for 20 percent probability he will wear his blue suit. How do I write that? Probability of what, given what, B given r complement. Probability that, if it is not predicted to rain, what is? given that it is not predicted to rain, what is the probability that he will wear his blue suit? That is 0.20.. Last one is: given that it is not predicted to rain, probability that he will wear his gray suit. What's wrong with me today? 0.80.. The question was: write down at least four pieces, but we have all this information from the question. Any questions so far? Is this clear: You have to mention the events as well. You cannot just write 0.7,, 0.3.. You have to write the events under question as well. That's A part. What is B? It's? second question says: what is the probability that Jeff will wear a blue suit on a given day? What are we trying to find? Probability of what B? B given R, R given B? what B? Probability of just B. But that even B is dependent on whether we have R event or R complement event, right? So that even B is dependent on two other events. So what concept are we dealing with in this question? The law of probability, right. How do I calculate it? What is the formula? Probability that he will wear his blue suit, given that it is predicted to rain, multiplied by probability of event that it is predicted to rain, plus probability that he will wear his blue suit, given that it is not predicted to rain multiplied by probability of R complement. It is not predicted to rain because B event here is dependent on R and R complement. Hence the law of probability is being used. Can you find the answer to this? Please solve. You have all the values. What is the answer? 0.35, B given R. 0.7, 0.3 plus 0.20 multiplied by 0.7,, 21,, 14,, 0.35,, yep, Okay, Okay, Okay, Is that clear, Okay? Next question: If Jeff is wearing a gray suit, what is the probability that the weather forecast was for rain? What are we trying to find? What is the-. what do I write in the bracket? Sorry, B complement, B complement. B complement would be probability that Jeff will not wear or will wear a gray suit. Question is: if Jeff is wearing a gray suit- we know that he's wearing a gray suit- what is the probability that the weather forecast was for rain? R given B complement, Yes, We are saying, given that he wears a gray suit, that is B complement. what is the probability that it was predicted to rain? That is what we're trying to find. That is what we're trying to find. There's a conditional component. Given there is an event that has happened, what is the probability of something? right Now, what concept to use here? We don't have intersections here. We can use Bayes' theorem. We have to find probability of R given B complement. Can we use Bayes' theorem to first find probability of- that is Bayes' theorem. Probability of A given B is equal to probability of B given A multiplied by probability of A over probability of B. In this question we are saying probability of B. In this question we are saying probability of R given B complement is equal to- can we do B complement given R? If this is R and this is B complement, then this basically becomes probability of B complement given R multiplied by probability of what. So R over probability of probability of B complement, Bayes' theorem, right, Yes, So you have to relate what events you have and you can just use Bayes' theorem to now find You have B given B complement given R. you have to find R given B complement. In this scenario you can use Bayes' theorem, correct, What is probability of B- what is the probability of B complement given R? 0.3 multiplied by what is the probability of R 0.3 over probability of B complement? 1 minus probability of B, which is 0.35.. That is 0.9 over 0.65.. You can just leave it up to that. Okay, Clear, Clear. Any questions so far. Last question: 10 percent of all students are left-handed. Let's say there is an event L for students who are left-handed. Among left-handed students, 75 percent are male. Let M be an event student males: 0.75.. What is the probability of L in this question? 10 percent of all students are left-handed. Probability is 0.10.. What is the probability among left-handed students, given they are left-handed? What is the probability being the male: 0.75.. Among right-handed students, L complement right: 55 percent are males. So, given that they are right-handed, probability in the male is 0.55.. What is the probability that the student is left-handed, given that they are male? So you have to find L given M. Solve this. You have five minutes. I want all of you to solve this. Actually you'll need more than five minutes, but yep, That is Bayes' theorem. if you need that for reference. You have M given L. You have to find L given M, Right. So it's a Bayes' theorem question. There's a exemplo. All right, It is usually aант 5.. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. In this case you might need a calculator, which is fine For your tests and exams. you will get a calculation which is easier. You might not need a calculator for that. You don't have to worry about it, This question. you might need a calculator. You can use your phone, it's fine. If this is a basis theorem question, I'm not solving it, but I'm just writing the first step. If this is a basis theorem question, how do I write it? in terms of this formula, If I have to find probability of L given M, can I write probability of M given L? Well, probability of L divided by what? Probability of M? Now, you don't have probability of M, So you have to first find probability of M. That even M is dependent on whether person is left-handed or right-handed, right? So there are two events it's dependent on. So first you will have to apply law of probability. So in this case you will be using this formula. This is another form of Bayes' theorem. This will be used for this question. So you have to first find probability of M. for this question, Which formula will you use to find the probability of M? What do I write? We're using law of probability, right? What do I write? No, just like formula: Probability of M given L multiplied by probability of L plus M given L complement, which is basically right-handed, multiplied by probability of L complement. Good. So you'll have to first find probability of M using law of probability. Once you find probability of M, you can plug it here and you have all the values to find probability of L given M. Can you solve it now? Can you solve it now? You have all the formulas that are needed to find your main question. So you're using law of probability first, and then that is Bayes' theorem. If you just write it together, that is also one form of Bayes' theorem. So you have to solve it. Correct, Correct, Correct, Yes, Correct. So I want you to solve this at your own time. Okay, Has anyone solved it? Has anyone solved it? Has anyone? What is the answer? Sorry, Which is If you use a calculator. So answer will be 0.1316, so it's an approximate value. I will just say that. Just check if you get this. I want you to solve this. I don't want to solve this. All right, Okay, Yep, All right, I'll see you in the next lecture now. Wait, All right, That's it última. Okay, I want you to solve it. All right, All right, All right, Hold on, We'll wrap this up. Go ahead, Hold on, Come on, All right, Go ahead, Go ahead, All right, Go ahead, All right, We'll leave the window now. Come on, Come on, Go ahead, Get us Got yours And we'll do that much faster. Whatever is that, Come on, Come on. It's too long, Get us, Come on.
