<h1>Partial Orders</h1>
<p>
    Sorry for that. I just wanted to make this work so we will use this one, which means you cannot see it. Yeah, okay, Today we are going to talk about partial orders. A relation is a partial order if it is reflexive, anti-symmetric and transit. We discussed some cases of anti-symmetry in the last lecture. Some cases are like: if we suppose have a relation of less than equal to for all real numbers, that is a classic case of anti-symmetry, right? Maybe a subset relation for a set of all subsets. Division, if A divides B, is a relation for all natural numbers. For this scenario here, can you check if this is a partial order? For this relation divides for all natural numbers, which is your universal set, excluding 0. So, is this relation a partial order, which means: is this reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive? Try, We've already discussed division for anti-symmetry, so it should be easy. Tell me if this relation here- division for all natural numbers- a partial order relation, Is this reflexive, Reflexive? We can say: 2 divides 2, that's true. 3 divides 3, everything divides itself. so it is reflexive, Transitive. Is this anti-symmetric? Is this anti-symmetric? We've already discussed division. It is anti-symmetric, right, If A divides B and B divides B. B divides A, that can only happen if A is equal to B, correct? What about transitive? Is this transitive? What is the property of transitive? If A is related to B and B is related to C, then A must relate to C. Is that the case for division relation as well for all natural numbers? If 3 divides 6,, is that correct And is that in a relation? So we can say 3, 6 belongs to a relation. 6 divides 12,, which means 6 to 12 is in relation. Does that mean 3 divides 12?? Yes, which means 3, 12 belongs to a relation. So in this case the relation is also transitive, correct? If R is my relation, which is division, then we can say that R is a partial order relation Because it is reflexive, it is anti-symmetric and it is transitive, correct? Now we discussed anti-symmetry, and how do we check in a digraph if it is anti-symmetric or not? When we have a digraph, how do we check if it is anti-symmetric or not? If we have double arrows, then it is not anti-symmetric, correct? Let's take an example for a matrix now. Let's take- I have a question actually. yep, Let's take 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.. Can you tell me if this relation is symmetric? It has nothing to do with anti-symmetry, just for division. Can you tell me if that is symmetric? How do we check that Transpose, Transpose. so I will. actually, I will first get a matrix which is a transpose of MR, which means rows becomes columns. That is 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0. That's MR transpose. To check symmetry, MR should be equal to MR transpose. Is that the case here? No, So it is not symmetric. When I say it is not symmetric, what does it mean? Relation right, R is not symmetric, correct. Now to check anti-symmetry, we first get MR and MR transpose matrix. We run an AND operation for these two matrices here 1 and 1, 1,, next 0, 0, 0, 0, again 0 and 1, 0 and 1.. 0 and 1, 0 and 1, 0 and 0, 1 and 1, 1, 0 and 0, 1 and 1.. 0 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0. That's your MR and MR transpose matrix. To check anti-symmetry, you have to check if MR and MR transpose matrix is a subset of identity relation. What is an identity relation? We discussed this before. What is an identity relation? All diagonals, The main diagonal has elements 1, rest is 0. That is an identity relation. We are saying MR and MR transpose matrix. the matrix that you will get after running this operation here should be a subset of identity relation, right? Or, in simple words, how can you say, instead of just this, what can you say in plain English? How do we check if this is anti-symmetry? Just check if the main diagonal. there are no 1s of the main diagonal. That's what you have to check for anti-symmetry. If MR and MR transpose is a subset of an identity relation, then R is anti-symmetry, right. Or if there are no 1s of the main diagonal, then R is anti-symmetry. Same thing, correct? We're saying it's a subset. It doesn't have to be all 1s. If suppose, after running this operation I get a matrix: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.. That's a subset of an identity relation. We don't have 1 here, but it's still a subset. It can be equal or some elements of a particular set. That is anti-symmetric, correct? That's how you check if a relation is anti-symmetric or not using a matrix. Let's try one question. We have MR. We have MR Mistake. Check if R is a partial order relation. We have five minutes Using matrix form. Check if R is a partial order relation. When is it a partial order relation When R is Exactly. That's how you will check using matrix form. now There are different ways you can check: using a digraph, using a set, using a matrix. Use this matrix to check if R is a partial order relation or not. To check for transitivity, you have to perform matrix multiplication as well. If you can find that it's just not reflexive or something, you can just solve your anxiety. it's not a partial order With the reflexive, you're only checking the main matrix When you're checking. or you can just say: but you have to still show you're working. If I ask R is a partial order relation or not, and if it's not reflexive, you don't. you have to show you're working for other properties as well, Otherwise you'll lose marks. Your answer is correct, but you still have to show you're working. Yeah, I don't see everyone solving. I don't see everyone solving. I don't see everyone solving. I don't see everyone solving. I, If you just we don't know, You don't know. It's a quite a bit, I would say. If there's a lot of different things, do you know? We've been involved in the process and have to show you a finiteem who will go best for people? and now I'm working. so far, I agree with you. Please don't film лил░ all. I agree with you. No, no, But it is also happening. Tina Fey can also make sure that the welcome cheat letter And the moment that you're in the place of surgery and then welcome tomorrow. Thank you, Is this a partial order? No, Is R reflexive? No, R is not reflexive. We don't have a 1 here. Is R anti-symmetric? It is. What was MR and MR transpose. What was the matrix? Sorry, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.. 0, 0, 0, 0.. Everyone got the same matrix. Is that correct? Okay, Now, that is a subset of an identity relation. Also, there are no ones off the main diagonal, which means R is anti-symmetric. Now is R transitive. How do we check that? So you first calculate MR squared. What was MR squared? I'm not calculating it, I'm trusting you guys. It's your question. What is the matrix? Just MR? Is this your answer? I'm assuming that's correct. I don't know the answer. Okay, Now this next step is we calculate this MR bracket where we change, replace anything that's greater than 1 as 1, but in this case we don't have to. So this matrix is the same matrix, so I can just write it like that, Correct. Now I'm saying: if there is a path of length 2, there should be a path of length 1.. If there is a path of length 2, there should be a path of length 1, right, That's where we're checking. if this is a subset of MR, and it is correct. So R is transitive. So R is transitive. Therefore, R is a partial order. Oh, sorry, It's not reflexive. No, It is not a partial order. Yeah, Question: Yeah, Since the transition is the same, well, does that mean it's also symmetric and asymmetric order? Yeah, That can be. We discuss it. Yeah, Because there are two different properties. It's not linked. Yeah, All right. Now we'll discuss Hasse diagrams. Now you can create Hasse diagrams from a partial order relation owner. Right, If suppose we have a relation divides for a set- 1, 2,, 3,, 6,, 8,, 12,- right, Now, when we create a Hasse diagram, first thing we have to do is draw a diagram for this relation, And when we create a digraph for a partial order relation, the arrow should always go up. That's the standard, because it's easier to create a Hasse diagram after that, Right, Okay, So if I have to create a Hasse diagram for this one, what relations can I get? We have 1,, 2,, 3,, 6,, 12, what is left? 8.. 1 divides 3.. 1 divides itself. If this is a partial order relation, it is reflexive, right? 1 divides 3.. 3 divides 6.. 6 divides 12.. 6 divides 12.. 1 divides 2.. 2 divides 8.. 1 divides 3.. 2 divides 8.. 1 divides 8.. 1 divides 2.. 2 divides 8.. 1 divides 8.. 1 divides 8. also divides 8, 1 divides 6, 1 divides 12, 3 divides 12, 2 also divides 12.. Is there anything that's missing? Yes, Good, Anything else? Am I missing something here? No, So first step is digraph of a partial order relation, such as arrows go up the graph. Second step is we remove loops. We know that this digraph is from a partial order relation, right, And we're trying to make a Hassi diagram. Hassi diagram is only for a partial order relation. We know that if we have these elements- and it is a partial order relation, it is reflexive. We don't have to show this, It's already known. So first step is remove shortcuts. What do shortcuts mean here? What shortcuts am I talking about Exactly, Good, We're talking about a transitive shortcut here. If 1 divides 3,, 3 divides 6, we're saying 1 divides 6.. We know it's a partial order relation, it is transitive. We don't have to show this relation here. right? We can go from 1 divides 3,, 3 divides 6, then 1 divides 6.. There is a path. We don't need that shortcut for a Hassi diagram. So what are all the shortcuts that I can remove from this? I can remove this. 1 divides 12 can go from here, so I don't need this. Right. What else? 1 divides 2,, 2 divides 6,, 6 divides 12, so I don't need this. It needs to be linked. We just don't need shortcuts, right? Anything else that I can remove from here: 1 to 8, yes, because 1 divides 2, 2 divides 8, so there is a connection. Anything else? Am I missing something? I might miss something. It's a confusing graph. I don't see any issues now. Yep, so we have removed all the shortcuts, so now we can make a Hassi diagram. Hassi diagram is only for partial order relations because we know it is reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric. We don't need to show all the properties when we know that there will be a shortcut. It is going to be related to itself. So we're going to make it simpler. So we have 1,, 3, 6,. we don't need that. 12, 3, that's cross. so we have 2 here. 2 divides 6, that goes here. 2 divides 6, that goes here- and 2 divides 8.. Anything else? Is there a relation that I'm missing? We've removed all the shortcuts. we've removed all the reflexive components. that is your final Hassi diagram for this relation. Relation divides on a set. When you create a Hassi diagram, if you want to check if there's something wrong, if you missed some shortcuts, you just have to see if there is any triangle in the Hassi diagram, because we're avoiding this scenario here. right? If there are any triangles in your Hassi diagram, then that's not a Hassi diagram. You're missing. You have to remove that shortcut, right? That's one of the things that you can see when you make your final Hassi diagram. If there is anything that's wrong, you can just check. There should not be any triangle component in your Hassi diagram. Is this clear Now? if I look at it, and if you don't have this, you can still say it's a Hassi diagram, which means it has been constructed from a partial order relation, which means we have some hidden relations which we have not shown in the digraph. It's much more cleaner, but we know that one is related to itself, three is related to itself, and so on. We also know if one divides three, three divides six, then one also divides six. We don't have to show that relation if it's a partial order relation. Is that clear? Any confusion? All right, So if you have a relation, you can create a Hassi diagram. Now, what if you have a Hassi diagram? It's just. I have a question which I can use. So we have w, x, z, y and v- Let's go up Missing something- Y, z, x, w, v. Yeah, If you have a Hassi diagram, you can go back to the relation. right, That is a partial order relation Because it's a relation from a Hassi diagram, correct? It's also called as a set of all the relations that follow a partial order relation. Sometimes in your assignments or assessments, if I'm saying, find the set of this Hassi diagram, we're basically talking about a partial order relation. What all relations can I write? now Try this: If you have this Hassi diagram, can you write all the set of ordered pairs that basically are partial order relations? Yeah, Exactly, Because it's a Hassi diagram, right? So Hassi diagram is reflexive. We're basically saying everything is related. So all these relations are hidden because we don't really have to show them. Correct? That is a relation. We are saying: if z is related to y and y is related to v. then there's also a transitive component. There is also this hidden relation here which we're not showing. If z is related to y, y is related to x, then z is also related to x. if it is a Hassi diagram, We don't see any double arrows. We don't see any double arrows. So it's also anti-symmetric. So what all relations can I write here? We can start with reflexive property. We can have z related to itself, y related to itself, x, w, v. What else z is related to y? You tell me. You tell me All the shortcuts that we have removed Exactly, So we have this. First we write: z is related to y, y is related to v, So z is also related to v. What else z is related to y? y is related to x, So z is related to x. z is related to w, w is related to x, z is related to x, already there, Anything else. So when you have a Hassi diagram and you write a partial order relation, you're basically considering all the hidden relations. we've removed all the shortcuts that we have removed from the diagram here. So if you have a relation, you can make a Hassi diagram. If you have a Hassi diagram, you can go back to that relation, Anything else? Is there anything that I'm missing? I don't think so. We've covered everything, right? That's your partial order set. Any questions so far? So z is related to x by y and by w. so do you need to know that at my school or No? Because we're just talking about relation ordered set. It needs to be unique, right? I don't know if we have much time, but there is one more question that I would like you to do. If I have a universal set, which is a power set of a set- A, B, C- power set is set of all subsets of A, B, C, right? You have discussed that in the first half, right? So power set is the subset of all subsets. We have an empty set. We can also have A, B, You have, right, You have discussed this. Okay, Let's see very confusing phrases. So A, B, C, what all subsets can I make from A, B C? You can have A, B. You can have A C, B C. You can also have A B C. These are all the subsets, set of all subsets for A B C. Now, relation is a subset X and Y in relation. if X is a subset of Y, If that is my relation here that null set is a subset of this. Every set has a null set, right? You know that? right, Yeah, Okay, Just don't show me confusing phrases, otherwise I'm like: do you know this or not? Okay, This as well, That as well. We also have a relation That also has an empty set. Now, C is also a subset of this. C is also a subset of that. A is also a subset of this. Now, do you see why we need a Hassi diagram? I don't understand anything after a certain point. That is crazy. See, That's why we need a Hassi diagram. At some point, you will just get confused. Even if you make it, how will you explain it? Everything just overrides everything. Now, can you make a Hassi diagram for this? Try Basically trying to remove all the shortcuts. There is also this relation here which we didn't add. Yeah, It's a digraph, right? Such a mess, Such a mess. Let's try making the Hassi diagram for this, Trying to remove all the loops. And we're trying to remove all the shortcuts. Okay, Let's try to remove all the shortcuts. You have to practice this, because if you don't practice it, it will be time-consuming during your assessments, which is not a very good thing. Consider this as practice, Doctor, You have to practice this. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you, Thank you. Done, Anybody Done? Let's see. Okay, That's correct. This is related to here. I don't need that shortcut, I can skip that Right. B is a subset of BC. That's the relation. I can do that. That's correct. That's correct. That's correct. A subset of AB. B is also a subset of AB. What else? What else? A to AC, A to AC, No, B to AC, What I'm just asking you, I'm just asking you: A to AC, Yes, Okay, So we're not including this. Then, AB to ABC. AB to ABC. Yes, That's correct, It's fine. if it's wrong, You need to practice. So we're saying that AC means so we're going to be the same. So, AC, AC to ABC, Yeah, That's correct. BC to ABC. What else? So BC to ABC, BC to ABC. Do we see any triangles here? No, Yes, Triangles, No, Yeah, Yeah. And if I had this relation, it would be wrong, because I see a triangle, which we don't need for a HACI diagram. No, I'm talking about this: Some triangles and diagram. How Do you see any triangle? I can't see any triangle. No, No, No, No, I'm just talking about the connection. It needs to be a connection. It's like: where do I see? Yeah, Okay, Okay, All right, Good, If we had this relation, it would be wrong, because we see two triangles. They should meet, They should meet, They should meet, They should meet, They should meet, They should meet. Okay, Okay, All right. Good, You get the same answer, Same Good. That's your HACI diagram for this complicated thing here. So if you have to go back to the relation, you know everything relates to itself and you also include all the transitive properties in here. So you don't necessarily have to, because it's already up. We're basically going up the diagram. You don't really have to show arrows in the HACI diagram because it's already known that it's going up. All right, Any questions? We have to quickly discuss your last property, which is a total order. Let's create a HACI diagram for a relation less than equal to, for a set minus 2, 1,, 4, 7.. Can you quickly make a HACI diagram? It's very simple. We only have four minutes. The relation is less than equal to for the set minus 2, 1, 4, 7.. Thank you. Always make sure when you're making a diagraph for a partial order relation, it always goes up. It's easier to make a HACI diagram: Minus 2 is less than 1.. 1 is less than 4.. This is your HACI diagram for this relation here. Yeah, and that's like a diagraph, and when you create a HACI diagram, everything relates to itself. You remove the shortcuts Eventually. it will be the same. When you find an optimal path that everything is related to itself, you finally will get a straight line. right? If you get a straight line as your HACI diagram, it's called total order. You mentioned somewhere here- I don't know, Not very good with teaching from slides and materials- but yeah, If your HACI diagram is a straight line, then that means everything is related to everything here. right, That is called a total order. So your partial order is basically total order. clear, You're good with HACI diagrams. diagraph relations. This was your last lecture for relations and functions. From the next lecture we'll start with counting theory, So it's going to be slightly different from what we were discussing for the past two weeks. So if you have any questions, you can just come meet me during my office hours or just come in If you see me, just ask questions. Don't worry about that. All right, I'll see you next week.
