<h1>Lecture 20 Relations</h1>
<p>
    Okay, Let's start. All right. So I've been told to tell you guys that your test is probably be conducted next Friday. It's a 45-minute test and it will cover everything from week four to week six. So week four, week five, week six, everything that Tim covered in the first half, right? It will not cover anything from the second half when I took over, So that will be covered in test three, So don't worry about that. So everything covered in week four, week five and week six will be a part of test two. Calculators are not allowed and make sure you read the instructions. They are now on Moodle So you can just go and read the test notice on Moodle. Any questions regarding test two, Any specific questions? If there is anything, you can just send him an email. send him an email or you can just talk to him about anything specific that's not in here. right, For test two. if you go to week eight on Moodle, Tim will also upload some revision material for a second test, probably by Wednesday or Thursday, So you can just use that material for practice. All right, So it should be there on Moodle in a few days. All right, Let's start with your assignment question. first, Look at question 3B, part. What is this? A less than B, less than C, less than D? Is that what it means? You know how to write a relation in a matrix form. now, right, I'm assuming you've looked at the lecture recordings on Friday. That is not A less than B, less than C less than D. That's an ordering for your matrix right. Use this as a relation. Let's take this as an example. We have a relation U which has a set of ordered pairs where A is related to B, B is related to itself, A to C and so on. Can you make a digraph for this relation? Try making a digraph for this relation. Do you think about that? What change startup that still works with the meeting with you need or something to be changed. yet Do not understand. Do not understand your expectations. Don't understand how to write a statement. Go students. do not understand what the relevant route to see. There are three aspects of your Bloch Street and Bloom. There are 4 Dream Broads. lond as a�럿. Go the window. look at him as a B. I don't understand what these are. списhold perfect. There are 4 or 4 defining regular H Protein facing criteria. We have A, B, C and D right. Is A related to B, B related to itself, A related to C, C related to A. so that goes back to A. B is related to D, D related to itself and D related to A. Did you get the same diagraph? That's your diagraph. Yes, yes, they're different relations. You remember when we were discussing symmetry? So they are different relations. Yeah, that's your diagraph. Can you now write a matrix of relation U? When there is a relation from one point to another, that is represented by one. If there is no relation, then it is zero. right? Let's try writing a matrix for this one. Now there is this thing here. How do you know that this will be A, B C D? I can also write B C D A and B C D A. Even that is not wrong, right? That's where ordering is important. If I'm mentioning that you have to write a matrix for a relation U and follow the ordering of this in your question, it is that correct? So your relation in matrix will always be A, B C D, A, B C D, And now you specify if there is a relation between these points or not. right? Can you write the matrix for this one If I've provided you ordering for this case as A, B C D and you give me this matrix. it's wrong, right? Just make sure, if an ordering is provided, follow that to write a relation in matrix. Is A related to itself? No, Should I write one or zero Zero? A related to B, One A related to C? One One Is A related to D? No, D is related to A, but we don't have A related to D. edge here. B related to A. Do we have that Zero Zero? Is that zero? B related to B? One, Zero? I'm not looking at it, I'm just trusting you guys at this point. Zero, Zero, Zero. Okay, If it's wrong, just tell me, I'll correct it. One, One, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero. Okay, If it's wrong, just tell me, I'll correct it. One One, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero. Now, this looks simple, but if you mess this up, everything goes wrong, And that's why I told you to write this. I don't know if that's correct. Let me see if that's correct. Yes, Good job, That is correct. So this is your relation in matrix form. Your relation is U. in this case, I specified ordering as A, B, C, D, and that's how you specify your ordering in your matrix, Right? If I've specified B, C, D, A, then you will use this matrix and then you will write: If B is related to B, then 1, and so on. So matrix will be different in this scenario, Right, But same relation. Is that clear? That needs to be considered when you will be solving this question here. All right, Okay, Now this is my relation U. That is a set of ordered pairs. That's a diagraph relation using matrices. Right, Three different ways of specifying the relation. So let's say I have a set V which has A comma B, B comma B and C comma A as set of ordered pairs, And even that is a relation. So this is a subset of U, Right? So can I write: V is a subset of U. If I write this in a matrix form, MV, and if my ordering is A, B, C, D, then Now you don't have to specify A, B, C, D. If the ordering is provided, you can just simply write the matrix. It's easier to write a matrix, That's why I write it. Okay Now, A to A: No, A is related to B, B is related to itself, C is related to A and rest is 0.. Right, That's a matrix for relation V. So this relation, can I say, is a subset of this relation, Right. Simply, we can just see if I circle one here, there should be one here. If there's one here, there should be one here Here. Right, So we can say MV is a subset of MU. Is that clear? All right. Now I want you to solve something. This is your MU matrix: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.. That's your MU matrix for relation U. Tell me if this is reflexive and symmetric. Please solve this. Is this reflexive? Why is this not reflexive? Yes, A relation R is reflexive if, and only if, the entries on the main diagonal are equal to 1.. Here, a relation is R, In our case it is U. So MU diagonals should always be 1.. Right, This is not reflexive. Another way of testing this is: we have something called identity Relation, Often represented as delta. This is basically 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.. This is your identity relation. Diagonal elements are all 1.. Rest is 0. That is called an identity relation. For your matrix here, MU, to be a reflexive relation, identity relation should be a subset of MU, Correct? Is this the case here? Is delta a subset of MU? No, Hence, it is not reflexive. Same concept, different ways of solving. What is a symmetric? How do we check if a relation is symmetric using matrices? If that is MU, how do we check if MU is symmetric? Transpose- We calculate a transpose matrix. What is MU transpose? How do we calculate the transpose of the matrix? That's matrix multiplication. Yes, Now your rows become your columns. First row becomes first column, Second row becomes second column, and so on. That's the transpose of a matrix. Transpose of MU will be: first row will become first column, Second row, second column, third row, third column. Sometimes when I say row and column a lot, I sometimes mess it up. I sometimes call it row as column and column as row. So it's a bit annoying when you say these things for an hour. Just correct me if I do that. So that's your transpose. Now what do we do? What do we check? Is MR equal to MR transpose? In our case, the relation is U, So we are checking: is MU equal to MU transpose? Is it? Are these two matrices equal to each other? No, Right, They're not equal, which means that this is not symmetric. Now how do we check transitivity? This is where we need matrix multiplication To check transitivity. the first thing we have to do is calculate MU square, And this is a bit complicated. Listen to this very carefully. There are different steps to check if it is transitive or not. So first you have a relation. You will calculate MU square, which is Right. What is MU? 0, 1, 1, 0.. Now you have to calculate this because I'm assuming you know how to do matrix multiplication, Multiplied by the same matrix again, Solve this And tell me what is the matrix. What do we get? Remember how do we do matrix multiplication. We take first row and first column, then first row, second column, first row, third column, first row, fourth column. Then we go on: second row, first column, and so on. Try, Try doing this. How many of you have watched Friday lecture? How many of you have not watched Friday lecture? Good luck, Good luck. How do we fill the matrix when you do MU square? This is what you want to do, right? You need a matrix. You basically take first row. First element will be row one, dot, product of row one and column one. Second element will be dot, product of row one, column two, Row one, column three. Row one, column four. Can you just talk? Wait, that's too loud. Now we take row two, column one, Row two, column three, Row two, column. Oops, sorry, See, That's what you do Column four and so on until we have row four. That's what we do, right? So for this first element here, we're taking row one, dot, product of row one, which is zero, one, one zero, multiplied by first column: zero, zero, one, one. What is the answer to this? Zero multiplied by zero plus. so we're saying zero multiplied by zero plus one multiplied by zero plus one multiplied by one plus zero multiplied by one, which is which is one, One, One, One. So this element here is one, One, One, One, One, One, One, One, One, One, One, One Over One من初 row, which is 0,01 and 1,0 multiplied by a column which is second here. So we take the second column, one, one zero, zero. That is 0 multiplied by 1 plus 1 multiplied by 1, 1 multiplied by 0, which is 1.. So this again is 1.. Solve this. Okay, don't look at my. solve it. Okay, what did you get? You have to solve this in exam and your test, so you need to practice this. It's fine if we go slow, but you need to solve this. okay, Let's just give them one more minute and then just go Question In a test, do we have to show the parking for it or No? you don't. That will be a lot of work. I will tell you, though, if I need working for something. So next tomorrow we'll discuss an algorithm. yeah, and that will be a bit confusing, but I would need working for that. Okay, What's the matrix? What is mu squared? We don't have much time. What is mu squared? What is your first row? It's 1, 1, 0, 1.. You already know that. What is the second row? 1, 1, 0, 2.. Third row, Fourth: Awesome, That's your answer. That's mu squared. That's your first step, right? You still have to check if it's transitive or not. Your first step was: you calculate mu squared. If relation is mr, you calculate mr squared, and so on. Now you will calculate something called mu two bracket. there is no name for it. yeah, Is the first row of this column the first row, first column. second row: is it zero? First column? Can you just say that again? So, row two, column one. Row two, column one: Yep. Second step is: we calculate something called mu two in brackets. And what is that? If you have anything in the matrix greater than one, replace it And replace it with one. What is the matrix? This remains as is. That becomes one. This is your mu two in brackets. There is no name for it, so I'm just going to say mu, two in brackets. Why do we do this? What does this tell you? This matrix tells you that's mu squared, right? If this is a and this is b, you're basically saying there is one directed path between a and b of length two, right? So if this is a and this is- oh, that should be a, sorry, Let's just say a and b. let's just say a and b. there is some vertex here. We're saying that there is one directed path of length two from a to b, correct? We're not interested in how many directed paths. There should be a directed path, and that's why we just replace it by one. We're interested in this matrix, correct? Now, if there is one directed path between a to b, there should be a shortcut for it to be transitive, right? If a is related to some- let's say it's d, d is related to b- then for this to be transitive, a should be related to b, right? So what we do is we have this matrix, mu. this is your original matrix. What is mu? 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.. That's your original matrix. That was mu. You calculated mu squared and then you calculate mu two in brackets, where you replace anything that's greater than one with one. Now you check whether mu is a subset of- oh sorry, now you check whether this is mu in brackets is a subset of mu. How do we check if this is a subset or not? You basically just circle. So if there is one directed path between a to a, there should be at least one shortcut, but we don't have one here, right? This is not a subset of mu, correct? There is one directed path between a and b of length two. There is one directed path of length one from a to b, but that is not a subset. Mu two is not a subset of mu. If it is not a subset, then this is not transitive. Now again, this requires practice. You will forget as soon as you move out of this lecture hall. You have to practice this at your own time. First step: you have a matrix. You calculate mu squared. Second, you calculate something called mu two in brackets where you replace anything greater than one with one, And then you check if that matrix is a subset of your original matrix, which is mu in this question. If it is a subset, then it is transitive. Otherwise it is not transitive. Yeah, Could you just get into doing in brackets two? I would prefer you do that for clarity, But if you know the logic then you don't really have to, Because we're really not interested in how many parts of length two. As long as we have one part of length two, there needs to be a shortcut. If we don't find a shortcut, which means it's not a subset, it's not transitive. Otherwise it is transitive. right, That's how you check whether it is transitive or not. Any questions? Now, if I give you a question, can you find if it's transitive or not? Okay, Then just take a question. We have a relation R and the matrix is 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1.. Check if this is reflexive, symmetric And transitive. I'll give you five minutes. Is five minutes? okay, It's a three by three matrix. It should be easy. I want all of you to solve this. We will have two major tasks Also for the second half, for the six weeks when I'm teaching, your best resource is lecture recordings, because we solve a lot of questions. Slides, you will just see one or two lines, not very helpful. I will put the algorithm which is probably there in books, but if I'm providing a better method. just go through the lecture recordings. That's much better than going through slides. It's just too boring and too complicated. Is this reflexive? Yes, Yes, Why. All diagonal elements are in relation, right? Or we can also say that delta, which is the identity relation, is a subset of mR. Delta is a subset of mR. therefore, r is reflexive. Is it symmetric? No, No. Let's calculate mR transpose. Transpose means rows become your columns, so it is 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1.. To check if it is symmetric, what is the condition? We check if mR is equal to mR transpose. Is this equal to mR transpose? r is not symmetric. Now check if it is transitive or not. What is the first step to check if this is transitive mR square? You have to find mR square, which is matrix multiplication, mR. Find this. What is mR square With? sure, I am happy. That's la måu. Let's give a minute. Make it close. Let's leave it, Chacha. That is one: 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1.. Do you get the same matrix? Is that your mR squared as well? What does this mean? If this is A, B, C and that is A B C, what does that 1 mean? This is not a relation. mR squared is not a relation. mR is a relation, right? What does mR squared tell you? What is 1 here? What does this mean? There is 1 directed path of length, 2, between A to A. What does that mean? 3 directed path of length, 2, from A to C. That is mR squared. What is your second step? What do you calculate? mR bracket? Yes, mR bracket. What do we do here? We replace anything that is greater than 1 as 1.. This is 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1.. What is your third step? Subset. We check if this is a subset of your original matrix, which is that mR, right? How do we check? We just circle the ones. We have: one here, one here, one here as well. It is a subset of mR. yeah, So we're going to think the original matrix is that mR Subset is always. it can be less or equal to. Is that equal to that? No, no, So we're basically checking if mR is a subset and it is a subset of your original matrix. Therefore, r is transitor. Is this an equivalence relation? Is mR an equivalence relation? Is r an equivalence relation? sorry, Yes, If r is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then r is also an equivalence relation, right? In this question. r is reflexive, but it is not symmetric. It is transitive, but all three conditions should hold. It is not symmetric, which means r is not an equivalence relation. Clear, Clear Any questions so far? Yes, All right, Same. Do you want to solve one more question? Okay, I'm pretty sure you're excited to solve one more question. Let's say we have a relation s. for now Let's not use r. I just want you to solve this and tell me if this is, is this symmetric? Is s symmetric? To check symmetry, you have to calculate Transpose, Transpose. Yes, You have to calculate ms transpose. Is this symmetric For this question? if someone writes that r is symmetric, that is wrong. You're talking about a relation s. To me, r is nothing for this question, right? In this question you're dealing with whether s is symmetric or not, Correct. So this is wrong. I'm trying to answer whether s is symmetric. Is it? It is. What is ms transpose? Rows becomes columns, So this is 1, 1, 0.. 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.. Ms is equal to ms transpose. Therefore, s is symmetric. Oh, Calculate ms square. That's the last thing. I will not bother you much. What is ms square? You know how to calculate and check if it's transitive, But, ms square is important. Give me the answer to this, My dear, Go away last. You can see this to me, V. I am just happy. I will not help you with these hands. Please get rid of every move so far and apply this. It is your symbol. You can see that with many more the letters Yes, Thanks, give me that My time. I wonder when you wait until it comes from here. you were going to be doing some stipulations. All right, yes, Thank you. 2, 1, 0.. 2, 1, 0.. Is this correct? Did anyone else get the same answer? What is the second row? 1, 1, 0, again, 0, 0, 1,. same matrix. What does this 2 mean? here? That is A B C. A B C. What does this represent? I need a complete answer. Directed path can be many lengths. yes, A directed path of. there are two directed path of length 2, from A to A. right, This is not a relation. This is a relation. Make sure that you identify the difference between the two. This is just telling you the number of directed paths from a certain vertex to a certain vertex of length 2.. If I calculate Ms cube, how do we calculate this? I have Ms square and Ms, which is 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.. This will give me Ms cube correct, If I get an answer. what is the first element? Just give me the first element for now: 3.. What does this mean? 3. What does this mean? Again, A, There are three directed paths of length 3, from A to A. because you're calculating, Ms cube, Ms square gives you the number of directed paths of length 2.. Ms cube, here will give you the number of directed paths of length 3.. And same goes on: M to the power 4, length 4.. M to the power n: length n. But this is not a relation. All right, Okay, That's all for today. See you tomorrow.
