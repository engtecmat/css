<h1>Counting</h1>
<p>
    Okay, Let's start. I have uploaded week seven, assignment seven, solutions on Moru. You can go have a look. Do you find any issues in assignment seven? Is everything okay? Today we're going to discuss permutations and combinations, which is a part of counting theory, And tomorrow some theorems regarding counting theory. On Friday you have a test, so we're not- there's no lecture. Everything I think it's mentioned. whatever is covered in test two, but whatever I'm covering for the second half, that's not part of your test two, So you don't have to worry about that, Right? Okay, Before discussing this, I use this example a lot. This is a deck of cards. We have 52 cards here. Right, If I have to draw three cards out of this deck of 52 cards, in how many ways can I draw my first card? Let's say I have to draw three cards, So I'm filling three different boxes. I use a box method to teach permutations and combinations, And I call it a box method. You won't probably find it anywhere else. That's the simplest way to explain counting theory. And then we use the formulas. Okay, This is my way of teaching. If you don't like it, don't really have to worry about it, But I have to draw three cards, which means I have to fill three boxes. In how many ways can I fill the first box, Which is, in how many ways can I draw my first card? I can get a 10 of hearts, Or some other person probably will get J, Some other person can get K, But in how many ways can I fill that first box? Any guesses? 52, because I have 52 cards. Right, There are 52 ways of drawing one card out of a deck of 52 cards, Correct? Now, if suppose I draw one card and I put it back, I'm basically saying that there's repetition. I'm involving repetition in my experiment- In how many ways can I now draw my second card? 52, because I'm now obviously repetition is involved. I'm putting that card back, So I already have 52 cards. again, In how many ways I can fill the third box or draw the third card? 52 again, right, Because I'm putting that card back and I have 52 cards. There are 52 ways of drawing my third card, Correct? If I have to draw three cards, in how many ways in total can I draw three cards out of a deck of 52 cards? There are 52 ways of drawing first card: 52. second, 52. third, when there is repetition involved. Right, When I'm putting the card back, there are 52 times 52. So 52 ways of choosing three cards out of a deck of 52 cards, Correct, Correct, Correct, Which basically is 52, right, This happens when there is repetition involved. What happens now? if I draw one card, In how many ways I can draw my first card? 52? Because I have 52 cards here. Now I do not put that card back. How many ways can I draw my second card? 51.. Third card: 50. Now, repetition is not involved in the scenario. Right, I'm not using the same card, So my deck of cards it's shrinking. So now, basically, I'm talking about 52 times 51, 50 ways of drawing three cards when repetition is not involved. That's the whole basis of counting theory, Right? Okay, Now read this: In an operation or procedure consisting of K steps and there are N1 choices for step 1, N2 choices for step 2, and NK for step K, the number of choices for each step is independent of how the previous step was performed. So we're basically saying we are drawing three cards. We are talking about three procedures: K steps here, N1 choices for step 1, 52 choices for first step, 52 for another, 52 for another, up to K steps. So we're drawing three cards, so up to three spots here, Correct. When repetition is involved, The number of choices for each step is independent. If I draw one card, put it back, draw another card, is it independent of the other one of your previous draw? It is, It is Right. One draw does not affect the other one. Well, when you are talking about the scenario where repetition is not involved, if you draw one card and you do not put that back, now it is dependent. Correct, That is a dependent scenario. but in this case we are talking about independent scenario, which is the first case here. Clear, How many four-digit PIN codes are possible when there is repetition involved? How many boxes do we have to fill here? Four, We have to create a four-digit PIN. talking about four boxes, Total possible options. How many possible options do we have here? For the first box, we have zero, one, two, up to nine, Correct. How many possible ways of choosing ten? Now, repetition is involved, right, If you have zero. if you choose zero as your first digit, how many options for the second one? Anything between zero to nine? Same thing. if you choose one first, You will have zero to nine digits option, like ten options. again, Same thing for the last one as well, If you choose nine as your first digit, you have ten options again, Correct? There are ten ways of choosing the second digit. Again for the third one, Zero to nine. Here as well, Ten ways of choosing the third digit: Ten again. So how many four-digit PIN codes are possible? That's your answer. How many possible standard number plates are there? Say, we have three letters and three digits. This is what you have to pose. You have six boxes. Can you try this? Can you find the answer to this one? How many options for your first set? Again, repetition is involved. How many options for this one? and how many ways can we choose a letter for the first box here? How many letters? Twenty-six. How many ways. Twenty-six ways of choosing a letter. Twenty-six again, because repetition is involved. Three letters, right? So twenty-six again. Three digits. How many ways we can choose a digit for this one? Ten, Repetition is involved. so ten again. Ten again. So for this question, the answer is twenty-six. How many possible standard number plates are there? These possible ways, Right? Ten has three pairs of shoe, one belt, two pairs of trousers and five shirts. How many different outfits are possible? Try, How many boxes are we talking about in this scenario? We're talking about different outfits, right, All right. So how many boxes? Four, One-four Shoe, One-four Shoe Belt, Trousers, Shirts, Shirts. How many ways of choosing a pair of shoes? Three, Three, Three, One, Two, Two, Three, Good, That's your answer. How many different outfits, How many different outfits are possible? Three times one times, two times five? That's your answer. Now your assessments for your test and for your exam. you don't, you're not allowed a calculator, right? Which means it's difficult to calculate something like that, correct? I'm not expecting you to give me an answer like a proper answer. If you just provide me this, I'm okay with that. As long as you provide me what all possible combinations or ways are possible, that's okay. right, When the last step is using a calculator, it's fine. okay For your assignments. if you want to solve it, it's good. You have a calculator, you can. But that doesn't matter. If you provide this, it's fine, okay. So if I'm not expecting you to give me an answer like a proper answer, If you just provide me this, I'm okay with that. As long as you provide me what all possible combinations or ways are possible, that's okay. right, When the last step is using a calculator, it's fine. okay For your assignments. if you want to solve it. it's good You have a calculator, You can. But that doesn't matter. If you provide this, it's fine, okay, Okay, Now permutations. Now think of the same question. We'll get to this: How many four-digit PIN codes are there without any repeated digits? Now, repetition is not involved. in the question. Earlier we were talking about repetitions possible in the scenario. Now we're not talking about repetitions, We're still talking about a four-digit PIN code. How many ways we can choose a digit without repetition? First, repetition doesn't matter. How many ways? 10? 10? 9?, 8?, 7?? Correct, Because repetition is not involved. we only have nine options, then eight, then seven. These number of ways of arranging a four-digit PIN code where repetition is not involved. Now, if my PIN code is 1234, and the other one is 3214, we're basically choosing the same digits. But is this equal to? are they equal? No, Right, Does that mean order matters in this scenario? So I'm saying order matters for this scenario. here, All possible combinations will be a part of this calculation here. Correct, 4, 1, 3, 2 is one possible scenario. In how many ways can we rearrange this number? Now we're choosing. we have 10 digits, correct? There are different ways of choosing 10 digits. We can also have 2, 3, 6, 8.. But then there are also different combinations of 2, 3, 6, 8, which will be a part of this calculation. here We can also have 8,, 6,, 3, 2, and so on. So in how many ways can we have different rearrangements of these numbers, these digits here? Okay, 16. 16. Up, We can think of it like a box method again. Yes, we're talking about rearranging, rearranging that 4 box, correct, Right, We're choosing 4 digits from that 10-digit scenario. But there are different ways of rearranging that 4-digit code as well, which is also a part of this calculation. So there are four ways of choosing 3, 2, 1.. So different combinations is a factor of 4 factorial, But all of these scenarios are being covered in the calculation that you just did. When order matters and repetition is not allowed, you're dealing with a permutation question. We're basically talking about different ways of rearrangement, different ways of selecting when order matters in the question That's a permutation question, How many permutations of 4-digit pin codes, How many ways you can arrange different 4-digit pin codes when repetition is not allowed? Second question: How many medal outcomes- gold, silver and bronze- are possible in a 100-meter race with 10 competitors? How many boxes? Three, One for gold, silver and bronze. How many ways we can choose Ten, Nine, Eight. Now, in this question, I don't have to specify that repetition is not allowed. If you choose a person for gold, you cannot choose the same person for silver or for bronze, Right? So that's where you have to think if it's a permutation question or not. If order matters and if repetition is not allowed, that's a permutation question. You have to read the question and see if it's actually a permutation question or not. Right Now, if I choose A for gold, B for silver, C for bronze, if I choose C for gold, order matters. Correct Permutation question. There are different combinations of choosing people. How many order mixtapes of ten songs from Beyonce can be made from 62 charting singles? How many? How many boxes are we talking about here? Ten, How many ways for the first one? 62?, 60?, 59?, 58? Up to 52?, 52?, 52?, I'm assuming? OK, Did you say so? OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK. Now, if I'm talking about 20 boxes, suppose I'm choosing 20, I want you to choose 20 songs out of 62, and how many combinations are possible? Now, box method is not a very optimal way to do it, Correct? In that case we use a formula. how many of you here are aware of a factorial method? okay, then we start with factorials first. what is a four factorial? what would? what do I mean when I say four factorial, four times, three times, two times one, and you stop at one. all the possible combinations, what is n factorial? until you reach one, right, six factorial, six, five, four, three, two, one, that's a factorial correct in permutation. we basically saying out of n elements. if we have to choose our elements, we can basically use this formula where we're saying n factorial over n minus right, for your question here: how many four digit pin codes are there without any repeated digits? what's n in this question? what's n, how many digits? ten, that's your, that's your subset. right, we're talking about ten digits and now we have to choose four digits out of that. so R is four. this basically becomes ten factorial. ten minus four factorial, which basically is ten times nine, eight, seven, six factorial. stop here, because that this cancels out. so we left with ten, nine, eight, seven, which is basically what you did. yeah, with the box method, same thing right now, when you're dealing with a question like that: how many ordered mistakes of ten songs? you're basically saying n is 62 e, 10. how many permutations of 10 are possible out of n- 62? how many ways you can select ten songs out of a total of 62 songs? and there are different ways of doing that. right, so you can just use the formula which is 62 factorial. 62 minus 10. factorial is, which means this should be 53, because that up to yes, 52 factorial, that cancels out that is 53, correct? so we're basically looking for a number of ways. which is 62 times 61 times 60, up to times 53. is this clear? yeah, it cannot be greater than n, because we're choosing out of n. it can be equal to n, cannot be greater than n. I can take an example. suppose you have six books on a shelf and that's a question for you. you have six books on a shelf. how many ways you can rearrange them? try that using the formula here. try this: give you two minutes. there are six books on a shelf and you just have. you have to find number of ways you can rearrange them. you can do it from a box method. I want you to use the formula what's n? that's what you have to find, right. what's n- six. what's r six? again, because you're choosing six out of six, but you're rearranging them right. order matters in this question, which means we're talking about six factorial over six, minus six factorial, which is six factorial over zero factorial. what is zero factorial? zero factorial is one right. that is basically six factorial over one. we're just talking about six times five, four, three, two, one, these many ways of rearranging six books on a shelf. one right, that is one right. that is one right. that is one right. that is one right. that is one right. okay, let's talk about combinations now. how many starting teams of size five can be made from a team of size 12? how many boxes? five, we're choosing five out of 12. how many ways of choosing someone in the first box? 12, 11. now we're basically saying there are 12 times, 11 times, 10 times, 9 times 8 ways of selecting five people out of 12. but now if i choose a, let's say we have c, d, we have 12 players right and i choose five place. if i choose a, b, c, d, e- it's a very weird name for players, but let's just assume that if i choose c first, b, a, d, does it matter? we're basically choosing five people out of 12, but order does not matter. i don't care like what order i'm choosing the players. i just want to choose five players out of 12.. doesn't matter if i choose, if i take t, d, e, f, h, i, doesn't matter if i choose i first, h, f, e, t. order does not matter, right? but in this scenario you're basically considering all the possible combinations. here we are over counting. we're over counting by a factor of five factorial, because there are how many ways you can rearrange them: five factorial. the same for the scenario is here as well, right, we're not considering order here because order does not matter, which means this scenario here is also counting the orders. so, basically, over counting, we have to divide this case by five factorial in the scenario, by the factor we are over counting with, right, this is over counting for this scenario. this will be your answer for the first question, correct. now, in this case, repetition is not allowed, right? if you're choosing one play, you cannot choose that player again. that's logical, right? so repetition is not allowed. does order matter? in this scenario, order matters. order does not matter, correct? doesn't matter if we choose display first or second or third. we just want to choose five player players out of 12 players in total. so order does not matter, repetition is not involved, which means it's a combination question. now, in your assessments i will not tell you if it's a permutation question or a combination question. you have to read the question and figure out whether order matters or repetition is involved or not and see if it's a permutation question or you just have to use a multiplication rule or a combination question. okay, so you have to understand the difference between permutation and combination. is the? is the difference clear at the moment? okay, so you understand why we are dividing it by five. factorial in the scenario. right, because we're avoiding the over counting scenario here. if you're choosing four players, then we are dividing it by four. factorial, because there are different ways of rearranging four players and order does not matter. so we divide by that component here. second question: how many lotto entries are possible where six numbers from 1 to 40 are chosen? before that, let's just talk about the formula. actually, it's better now we use a box method to calculate how many ways of choosing five players out of 12. right, we can also use a formula, also called ncr, sometimes it's called nr. i prefer this. it's much more clear that i'm using a combination question or a permutation question, right? basically, is n factorial, n minus r factorial. currently it's a permutation formula, but you're also dividing the over counting factor r factorial here. that now becomes a combination formula. okay, that's the difference. so for the first question here, how many starting teams of size five can be made from a team of size 11? we are choosing five players out of 12, so we're talking about 12 c5. that basically is 12 factorial, 12 minus 5. what is r factorial? what's r 5 factorial? now, if you just forget about the 5 factorial here, that is a permutation question and this basically is answer to the permutation question. so we probably have 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 factorial over 7 factorial. that cancels out. but we also avoiding over counting, which is a factor of 5 factorial. that basically becomes the same thing that we did here, but using the formula. right now. i want you to give me this: when you, when calculators are not involved, you can still open the factorial function, right, it's not that difficult. that would be your final answer, because from here you have to use a calculator, which is fine. you can also simplify it, but it's okay. if you want to leave it at that. when the last step is using a calculator, it's fine, we won't cut your marks. so how many lotto entries are possible where six numbers from 1 to 40 are chosen? what's n, c, r, what's n, what's n? are you choosing six numbers, correct? so we're talking about 40 factorial. 40 minus 6 factorial is 34 factorial and over counting by a factor of six, because we're choosing six numbers, different ways of rearranging. we don't want that because order does not matter, so we divide it by six factorial. that's your answer for the second one third question: you tell me how many ways are there selecting two class steps from maths 135, in which 197 students are enrolled? what's n and what's r? what's n? sorry, 197, yes, c, 2. that basically is 197 factorial, 2 factorial, correct. any questions so far? okay. now i want you to solve some questions. i've uploaded this on moodle. we have a lot of questions for counting theory here in this resource. 138. i want you to solve question 13, 14, 16. question 13, 14, 16, 17. please solve. sorry, Consider it as a practice, fair assessment. basically, There's nothing more to practice in counting theory. Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Do I have my class reps here? Thank you, Thank you. What's the answer for question 13?? 10 times 9 times 8, correct, 14.. It's a palindrome. You know what a palindrome is. Mention here, Any confusion with that thing? Now, in this case, we're talking about a five-letter word, correct? We're talking about five boxes. How many ways we can choose the first one? 26.. 26? 26 again, 26 again. Now we're basically saying: reach the same, forward or backward. There's only one way we can choose this, considering whatever it's- whatever the letters provided here. And there's only one way we can choose this one, considering whatever's here. So it's basically 26 times 26 times times one. These number of- We're basically saying if- suppose, if we take this question, we're choosing C I V. There's only one way we can choose this box. There's only one way: whatever's here, It's I. There's only one option For this one also. we only have one option: whatever's in this box. Here we're talking about 26 letters, But here we're talking about whatever is in this box. I'm just talking about one box, right? So sample space is just one. So we're just talking about one way here, one way here: 16,. how many ways are there of seating six people at a round table? This is easy. We're basically talking about rearranging people. What's the answer? Six factorial. Six factorial is basically six times five times four times three times two times one, Right, 70. That's a tricky one. How many ways are there of seating six people at a round table so that two specific people sit together? We're talking about filling six boxes. Now we have to make sure that two people sit together. How many ways of choosing my first box? Two, One. If I choose two people, there are two ways of choosing my first box, And then, if one is seated in this table, then there's only one left. Now we are left with four people. So we're left with four, three, two, one. It's basically two times one times four. Can you solve question 13 and question 14?? Can you solve question 13 and question 14?? Last question: Is question 13 a permutation question or a combination question, Combination question. why Exactly? Yes, Order does not matter in this case. We're basically just choosing four out of 16 members. We don't care if we choose first someone and then second, It doesn't matter, We're just choosing four people. Correct, Correct, Correct, Yes, Order does not matter in this case, We're basically just choosing four out of 16 members. We don't care if we choose first someone and then second, It doesn't matter, We're just choosing four people. Correct. And repetition is not involved. Repetition is not involved. If you choose one person, you cannot choose that person again. Correct. So it's a combination question. What is the answer to this one? What is NCR? What is N 16? C 4? Right, You know how to open this 16 factorial, 16 minus 4? Right, You know how to open this 16 factorial, 16 minus 4?? 14 question: Try this. And then The class reps need to present. The class reps need to present: Yes, You know how to open this Four. Yes, In that sense, What is the class? Yes, No, Yes, It's not good. No, Yes, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, I'm sorry, No. What is the answer to the first spot? The student has to choose five questions: two from part A and three from part B. How many ways can she make her choice? Five in part A and five in part B? Is that a combination question or a permutation question? Combination: right? We're basically choosing two from part A. There are total five. Choose two. There are different combinations of choosing two out of five And three out of five. These are different ways. Is that good? What about the second one? You know how to open this using the formula, right, So I'm not doing that, But you have to. Now for the second part. How many ways can she make her choice if she must choose five questions, At least two from each part, At least two from each part? Now what? It's a combination question again, But scenario is different. We're basically talking about at least two questions from each part. So we're saying she can either choose this or that. Is that clear In this question? yes, because you have five and five. But if suppose you have 10 in part A and two in part B- actually two would not make sense, but five in part B- then it's different. So we would rather keep it that way. Okay, Any questions regarding permutation and combination. You understand the difference between the two. So if you read a question, you will be able to find out. if it's a permutation question and you use a formula for combination, your entire question is just wrong. You won't get marks because your concept is wrong. So you have to understand the difference between the two and figure out which formula to use, right? All right, I'll quickly call my class reps here and then we'll just conclude. Let's conclude, Let's conclude, Let's conclude, Let's conclude. That's your poster and the link is provided at the top here, so I'll just go and read. Hey guys, so I'm the class rep for Maths 135 with Risa Key, who can't be here because she has an appointment. But yeah, so tomorrow we have a meeting where we're just collecting feedback about the class and how you're feeling at the moment, And we're just here to help you. If you have any concerns or questions about the paper, just feel free to provide your feedback on the form. And yeah, thank you, That's all. Oh yeah, and this is for the second half of the paper, not the first. Thank you, All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
