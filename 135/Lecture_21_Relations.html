<h1>Lecture 21 Relations3</h1>
<p>
    OK, let's start. If I have a set with these elements and a relation on this set- one, two and two comma three- That's the relation on set A. If I have to make another relation such that this relation is reflexive, I have to add certain set of audit pairs, correct? At this point this is not reflexive, right? We have one comma two, two comma three. What all set of audit pairs do I need to add to this new relation to make this R' reflexive? Yes, one, one, two, two, three, three. What's the definition of reflexive? When is the relation reflexive? When it is related to itself, right? If we add these set of audit pairs, this becomes reflexive, correct? This R' is basically a reflexive closure of a relation R. Clear, If I have to make this relation symmetric, we already have one comma two, two comma three. What do I need to add to this relation to make this symmetric? Symmetric is: if A is related to B, then B must relate to A. Yes, we need to add two, one and three, two. This is symmetric closure of relation R. Now, with transitive, it's a bit tricky. If we have to create an R' relation such that it is a transitive closure of R, we use an algorithm called as a Warshall's algorithm. Now, when I look at it, if I were you, I would just look at this and I would just probably just skip. It's just too confusing. I don't like teaching using these notations, So you're free to look at it. There are different books that will give you different kinds of algorithms that will give you the same answer At the end. you have to find a transitive closure. That's your goal when you have a relation given in the question. So I will try to make this as easy as possible. If you want to look at the slides, feel free, but it will be confusing. Okay, And also, this is very, very, very important for your assessments and generally very important. Okay, Let's take this question. I have a relation on set X. Can you write a relation- Can you write this in matrix form? This relation in a matrix form? It will define a matrix form. So you have to write a matrix, MR, and your ordering here is: did you get something like this? Can you check, figure out if I've done something wrong? See, Okay, Now with the Walshial algorithm, you'll start with your original matrix. This is also referred to as W naught. You start from your original matrix, which is MR, also referred as W naught, and you end at MR plus, which is your final matrix, which gives you a transitive closure of your original matrix, Which will also be up to W4.. Why W4?? If you start from W0, W1,, W2,, W3, and W4 will be your last matrix. Why? Why not W5?? Why not W5?? Yes, Yes, If the matrix is a 4 by 4 matrix, If your matrix was a 5 by 5 matrix, you end at W5. That is your MR plus, Clear. So you start from W0 and you finish at W4 for this question, because it is a 4 by 4 matrix. So W naught is your original matrix, which is 0, 1, 1, 0. You have to make W1 now For this one. you first highlight first row and first column, And this is what you will work with for W1.. Okay, W2, second row, second column, Wn. n row, nth row, nth column, Exactly. Now, what are you doing in this question here? If you look at the row here, in your rows here, you'll check zeros and ones And column will be used for OR operation. So you'll check zero. If you have zero in the first in your row, your first element is a zero. your column remains unchanged. So you write the column as it is Again zero. You don't change the column, just write as it is Again: zero, zero, one, zero, one. Now that's one. Now you run an OR operation for this column and your main column here. When you have zero in your row, you just write that column as it is. When you have one, you run an OR operation for that column which has one and your main highlighted column here With me. So now we run an OR operation: Zero OR one is One, One OR zero. is One, One OR one, One, Zero OR zero, Zero. That's W1.. Any confusion, Any confusion Now W2.. You highlight second row and second column. So you check zero and one in the second row here And you run the OR operation using the second column now to get W2.. Right, So we have a 1 here. We cannot write this column as it is. We will have to run an OR operation with this column. So we run OR operation for this and this now Correct: Zero OR zero. is Zero. Zero, One OR zero, One, One, One, Zero. Another element: That's zero. So we write the column as it is. We don't change the column, We don't run an OR operation. The third element is 1.. So now we run an OR operation for this column and the main highlighted column here. So 0 or 0 is 0, 0 or 1 is 1, 0 is 0, 0, 0.. 0 or 1 is 1.. The fourth element is again 1.. We cannot write this column as it is. We have to run an OR operation now for this column and the main column here. So this and this 1 or 0 is 1, 1, 1 and 0.. Is this okay? Sounds good Confusing. Do you want me to repeat anything? Okay, See, now you tell me what to do for W3.. Which row and which column? Third row and third column. So in your previous matrix you highlight third row and run OR operation using the third column here. So we check 0s and 1s in the third row. now We have a 1 here, which means I will run an OR operation for this column and the main highlighted column. 0 or 0 is 0.. 0 or 0 is 0.. 1 or 1 is 1.. 1 or 0 is 1.. And 0 or 1 is 1.. Next we have a 0. What do we do now? What do I write here? Nothing changes right, Because it's a 0. So the entire column is same for the next matrix as well. What happens to the third element in the row 0.. What do we do? We don't change anything. We don't change anything. So what do I write here? What will be this column? 0 or 0.. 0, 1.. 0, 1.. 0, 1.. Fourth element in the row is 1.. So now we have to run an OR operation for this column and the main highlighted column here, right, 1 or 0 is 1.. 1 or 1 is 1.. 0 or 1 is 1.. And 1 or 0 is again 1.. Now I want you to give me the answer to this matrix. now You solve this. OK, Done. And this column is 1, 1, 1, 1.. Yeah, yeah, I just want to see if that's correct. Yeah, Yep, Mm-hmm, Yep, Yep, Yep. Which row, which column? W4.. Fourth row and fourth column. So we'll check the fourth row for 0 and 1s and the fourth column for our OR operation, Right, 1.. Do we write the column as it is or do we run an OR operation for this one? We run an OR operation. so we will run an OR operation for this column and your main column here- 0 and 1 or 1- is 1, 1, 1, 1.. That is 0.. Nothing changes. We write the column as it is, That is 1, which means we run an OR operation again for this column and the main column here, 1, 1 or 0, is 1, 1,, 1, 1.. And that is a 1.. That's a tricky one. So we have a 1 here, which means we run an OR operation for this column with the same highlighted column, Right, Which means it's the same, Correct. The concept is the same, but we're just using the same column for running an OR operation, So that just goes all once. This matrix is basically your MR plus. You stop here because you don't have any more rows and columns to work with. Correct. And 4 is your last column, which is also called MR plus. It is also a transitive closure for relation R. You can make this relation as a diagraph, And this one the last one as well, And you can see that this will basically cover all the transitive properties for that relation R. Any questions, Any questions, Any questions. Okay, Then, if this is your diagraph, If that's your relation R, you first write all the ordered pairs for the relation R and I want you to find the transitive closure for this relation. You have 10 minutes, You have 10 minutes And I want all of you to solve this. Yeah, Yeah, Unex zou is the right One. No To dad, Your lead's syndrome. No, Okay, If it is your name R, if it's yourrs from there, then it's your ram. Thank you guys. And then I'll use thisнет now: Find MR plus. I should be different, so maybe just make it C and that B. I should be different, I should be different. I should be different. I should be different. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, to show everything that you've done for MR+. Thank you. Yeah, I just thought, if you don't have much, if you need more time, I can just validate using the answer that I have. That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. Thank you. I've changed the digraph a little bit in case you've missed it. I thought, if you need more time, I already have the answer. I can check, but I don't think do. I think you've already done. You're good students, I'm happy. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Four minutes, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. You guys know that we have maths help sessions as well every week. if you have any confusion regarding this topic or anything in your first half And during your exam time. we also have exams help session that will be useful. One minute, One minute, Okay. Which row, which column for? W1? First row and first column. what did you get? So you're dealing with first row and first column for W1.. You check zeros in rows or ones in rows. This is a zero, which means column does not change. We write it as it is. There's a one here which means we run an OR operation for this column column which has one and your main highlighted column here. right? So zero or one is one, zero, zero or one. Next is zero, which means I don't change the column here. It's zero, zero, zero, one. That's a zero again. so it's again. Did you get the same answer? W1? Okay. W2,. we're dealing with second row and second column. That's a zero, does not change: zero, zero, zero, one, again zero. We write this column as it is zero, again, one. Now we have one here which means we run an OR operation for this column and your main column here. So it's one, one or zero is one zero or one is zero, zero and one. See, Is there anyone who got this wrong? Okay Now, W3, we're dealing with third row and third column here. Everything is zero in the third row here, which means W3 is basically the same matrix as W2, because nothing changes right. So it is zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, zero, one. All right, Same answer: W4.. So fourth row and fourth column: correct. We have a one here which means we run an OR operation for this column and your main column here, Zero or one, is one, one, zero one. We have a one again, so we run an OR operation for this column and your main column: One, one, one, zero, again one. We have a one again which means an OR operation for this column and your main column, Zero or one, is one, one, zero, one, Again one. we run an OR operation with the same column. so this is the same column, nothing changes. one one, zero one. It's a four by four matrix, which means W4 is your MR plus, which is your transitive, transitive closure for your relation R. here Do you get the same answer. Is this clear? Good, So I'm assuming now you can solve Varshal algorithm and find a transitive closure Very important. Okay, so that's done. I have something else to discuss with you guys. When we were discussing properties of relation, we discussed reflexive, symmetric and transitive, And then we also talked about whether that relation is an equivalence relation or not. There was one property that we skipped, which was anti-symmetric. This is useful when we'll discuss partial orders in the next lecture. Let me take a scenario. Let's say you're dealing with a set of positive integers And you're saying, and your question is: A is related to B if, and only if, A is less than or equal to B. Is this reflexive? Is R reflexive? Yes, no, When it is related to itself. when an element is related to itself, then R is reflexive. right? Can this be reflexive? If A is 2, can 2 be less than or equal to 2? Yes, every element can be less than or equal to itself because there's an equal to component in that relation, right? So R? so R in this case is reflexive. is R symmetric? To check symmetry, we have to check: if A is related to B, then B must be related to A for it to be symmetric. So we're saying: if A and B is in relation, then does that hold or not? We're basically saying: if A is less than equal to B, does that mean is B less than equal to A as well. Is that the case? We just need one case where this is not possible for all A and B. We just need one contradiction: If 2 is less than equal to 5, is that true? first of all, that's true. Does that mean 5 is less than equal to 2? No, No. Therefore, R is not symmetric, because if 2 is related to 5, then 5 must be related to 2 for it to be symmetric. but we don't have that scenario here, because our relation is less than equal to correct. When do you think this will be true? When is this true? When is if A is related to B and B is related to A? when do you think this will be the scenario: A less than equal to B and B less than equal to A? Sorry, That's the same integer. Exactly, if A is equal to B, this scenario is only possible if A is equal to B. right, We can say 2 less than equal to 2 and because 2 is equal to 2.. In that scenario, R is anti-symmetric When A is related to B and B is related to A. if that condition is true- and that is only possible if A is equal to B- then you say that R is anti-symmetric. It's confusing but that's the best way to simplify it. right To check if it's symmetric. all the scenarios should hold If A is related to B, B is related to A. If that is not the case, then it is not symmetric, correct? But we are saying: if A is related to B and B is related to A, that condition- if it's only possible, if A is equal to B, then R is anti-symmetric. It is not the opposite of symmetric, It is something else, right? Clear? If you look at this in a diagraph form, if that is A, B, let's just say: is this symmetric? When you look at the diagraph, you have to check if it is symmetric or not. you're saying: if an arrow goes from one vertex to the other, it should also come back. right? There is a double arrow here, which means this is symmetric. right To check if it is anti-symmetric. there should not be any double arrow. If there is a double arrow, it is not anti-symmetric. Sorry, We don't count the loop as double arrow. Double arrow is one. come back. Yeah, That is not symmetric. but this is anti-symmetric because we don't have a double arrow, correct? So when you just look at the diagraph, you can see if there is no double arrow. it is anti-symmetric. Is that anti-symmetric? Is that anti-symmetric? We have to check if there is any double arrow. There is no double arrow, which means this is anti-symmetric. right, A is related to itself, A is equal to B. So we can say A related to A and A related to A, which means it is anti-symmetric. Is this symmetric? It is Because we have a loop. right, A is related to A. We can also say A is related to A, Same thing. right, It's a confusing scenario, but it is symmetric. All right, Can you give me one more example of anti-symmetry? I've used less than equal to. Is there any other example where a relation is anti-symmetric? Sorry, Great Smart. Any other different scenario? Can we say: subset A is a subset of B, because we can also have equal sets in that subset. How about A divides B? Is that anti-symmetric? It's saying A is related to B if, and only if, A divides B. Is this reflexive? Yeah, Is this reflexive? It has nothing to do with reflexive. I'm just revising your concepts. Is this scenario reflexive? Two divides two, Five divides five, One divides one. It is reflexive because it is related to itself. The elements are related to itself. So in this case, R is reflexive. Can I say: two divides four. That's true, And four divides two. That's correct. Is that correct? Four divides two. No, That condition does not hold, which means it is not symmetric, Right. A is related to B, but B is not related to A, So it is not symmetric. How about anti-symmetry? For it to be anti-symmetric, A related to B and B related to A must always hold if, and only if, A is equal to B. So in this scenario, 2 divides 2 and 2 divides 2.. Is that possible? True, So A related to B and B related to A is only possible if A is equal to B. Right, Which means this condition here, R is anti-symmetric. Clear, Yes, Okay, This is useful because we have to discuss partial orders in the next lecture. When it is not symmetric and not anti-symmetric, That's not symmetric. That's not symmetric. Why We have a double arrow. We're going B to C and C to B. Exactly, We have A to B, but we don't have B to A, So that's not symmetric. Is that anti-symmetric? No, because we shouldn't have a double arrow for it to be anti-symmetric, Right. We have a double arrow here. If B is related to C, for C to be related to B and for it to be anti-symmetric. B and C should be equal to. B and C are different. Right, This is not anti-symmetric as well. All right, Okay, I'll meet you in the next lecture. Okay, I'll meet you in the next lecture, Okay, Later.
