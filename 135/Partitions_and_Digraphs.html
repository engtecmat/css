<h1>Lecture 18 Partitions and Digraphs</h1>
<p>
    Okay. so I think it's got to 10 past, so I'd probably better start. So I'm back for a cameo just for today. Tanvi's at a short conference and I think she would have probably told you that also for Friday, there's a recording just for that one class. Okay, good, everything's up to date. then She would have introduced you to binary relations and, in particular, the properties of being reflexive, symmetric, transitive for a binary relation, and so let's just recap those a bit. So, and there's different ways- oh, that's great, isn't it? There we go. There's different ways of writing the two things related by a binary relation. So a binary relation, let's call it R. You can think of it as a set of ordered pairs from a set, A binary relation on the set X. So what this means is that it's a set of ordered pairs from X. So you can write that two things are related in one of two ways. You can say AB is in R, or you can write A is related to B, And either one of those ways is okay. This one's probably more common. So, as an example of a binary relation, it would be less than or equals on numbers. So we can write things like two is less than or equal to three. We tend not to write two comma three is in the less than or equals relation. But really a binary relation is a set of ordered pairs, So technically we should be able to do that, But we just tend not to. We tend to use this so-called infix notation. It's a bit like when you add two numbers, right, We don't tend to write plus two comma three, We tend to write the infix notation: two plus three. It's a very similar sort of thing. So I don't know exactly which one you've seen, but both of these are fine. I'll probably use this one mostly, at least today. Now, what does reflexive, symmetric and transitive mean again? So here, by the way, A and V are in our set X. Reflexive means that now we can use predicate logic For all A and X. A is related to A, So everything's related to itself. That often happens with a binary relation. It doesn't have to, though. It depends on the binary relation. So that's reflexive Symmetric is just that if A is related to B, then B is related to A. So for all A, B and X. A related to B implies B is related to A. That's symmetric. And of course it works the other way around too. B is related to A implies A is related to B. Just let A equal B and B equal A, and you get that. So this really covers both directions. This one less than or equals. that's definitely reflexive, isn't it? So 2 is less than or equal to 2.. Anything's less than or equal to itself. It was just less than, and that wouldn't work. But because we've made it less than or equal, it does. But it's not symmetric, is it? 2 is less than or equal to 3, but certainly 3 is not less than or equal to 2.. In fact, it's in some sense about as far from symmetric as you can get. The only time A is less than or equal to B and B is less than or equal to A is when they're actually equal. So that's sort of as unsymmetric as you can get for a reflexive relation anyway. And then there's the other properties: transitive For all: A, B and C. in X, if A is related to B and B is related to C, those two things together, let you deduce that A is related to C. That's the transitive property. So you can sort of- I don't know why the word transitive used. I guess you can sort of extend what you know. You can go from A to C via B, So that's the transitive property. Now, if you look at less than or equals as an example of a binary relation, if A is less than or equal to B and B is less than or equal to C, then yes, A is less than or equal to C, So that one is transitive. It's just not symmetric. Now, if we have all three of these properties, though, we call the binary relation an equivalence relation. It's kind of a bit like a generalisation of equality. It's the way I think about equivalence. So if you think about equals on any set that will satisfy these three things, A is equal to A. If A equals B, then B equals A. If A equals B and B equals C, then A equals C. Those things are all obviously true, aren't they? So equals is an equivalence relation. However, there are plenty of other examples, So you would have seen some. Here's one which we can give. that's quite easy. You just look at the people in this room, for example, and you define a relation by saying two people are related if, and only if, they have the same birth date. same date of birth, just the day of the year, let's say. Forget about the actual year, And then some people will be related and some won't. of course, It's obviously reflexive. You have the same birth date as yourself. If A has the same birth date as B, then B obviously has the same birth date as A. It's almost saying the same thing, isn't it? And if A and B have the same birth date, and so do B and C, then of course A and C must as well. So that's a very typical example of an equivalence relation, because there's some sort of function defined on people, which is what their date of birth is, and you're saying: when are those function values the same? So if they're the same for two people, you define them to be related, and that's always going to give you an equivalence relation, if you think about it. So another example is logical equivalence. Well, for this one, how do we decide when two formulas are logically equivalent? So we have, let's say, formula 1.. P is equivalent to Q. It just means they've got the same truth table, isn't it? So the truth table is the thing you associated with it. So that's the thing that's the same that decides whether they're equivalent. So it's really like some aspect of them is equal. So two formulas are said to be logically equivalent if they give the same truth table, And obviously is that one going to be an equivalence relation? Well, obviously a given formula has the same truth table as itself If it's got the same truth table. if P's got the same truth table as Q, then certainly Q and P have the same truth table, of course. And then if P has got the same truth table as Q and Q's got the same truth table as R, then obviously P and R must also have the same truth table. So logical equivalence is an equivalence relation, Hence the name. And one other one that we just saw before I finished my stint of teaching was congruence modulo N. Now, how do we define when two things are congruent, modulo, let's say, three? Well, they have the same remainder when you divide by three. That's the definition. So is that going to be an equivalence relation? Well, again, it is, because it's a property of the number, It's whether or not it's got a particular relation, a particular remainder. So you compare the remainders of the two numbers to decide if they're congruent modulo three, or any N actually. And so, for the same reason, that's going to give you an equivalence relation as well. So let's check it though. A is congruent mod N to itself, isn't it? Because A has the same remainder as itself. If A and B have the same remainder, mod N, then B and A do. If A and B do and B and C do, then of course A and C must as well. So it's pretty easy to see that's reflexive, symmetric, transitive, So we do get an equivalence relation there. So this is a really nice example of an equivalence relation. So definitely, equal things are always equivalent under any equivalence relation. That's the reflexive property. But there's more stuff that's equivalent than just equal things in general. Now there's a very closely related concept to equivalence relations, which is the idea of a partition, And so let me just define those first, And these are also on the other slides that Tanvi's put up, the definition of a partition. But here's what it says. This is also up there too, this material. You've got a way of splitting the subsets of X. So think of a picture: Here's X, This is our big set, And then we break it up into subsets, say X1, X2, X3, X4. And it might even be an infinite number of bits that you split into actually. But the point is So, these i's and j's, they don't even have to be natural numbers. They're elements of what's called an index set. But these are just supposed to be different subsets of X, different subset for each different little subscript. here The intersection of any two of them is nothing. So that's why I've drawn them like this. They're patches which cover your whole set. Everything is in exactly one of the patches, So no two different ones intersect at all, And if you take all of them together you get the whole set. So everything's in exactly one of the patches is really what it's saying. And these patches are called equivalence classes, And we'll see why in a minute. They're also called cells, because they're little pieces of this partition. But this all does relate very closely to equivalence relations, as we'll see. So a partition of a set is a splitting of it into particular subsets whose union is the whole set, and those subsets don't intersect at all. So every element of the set is in exactly one of those subsets. So you get a sort of picture like this: And another way of saying this is if two things do overlap at all, then they must be the same patch. If two patches overlap, they've got to be equal, because if they're not equal they don't intersect at all. It's just sort of the opposite way around from saying this. So let me give you an example of a partition of just a nice finite set with only 10 elements in it. Let's just take the numbers 1 to 10, keep things nice and simple. Well, I can break that up into three subsets like this. These are just Obviously they don't intersect These sets. you can see there's no intersections between the members, And if you take the union of these three sets, you get the original X back. To put all that another way, every element of X is in exactly one of these three sets. If it was in two, then those two patches would intersect. So that's not allowed. And if anything was missing from these, then the union wouldn't be the whole thing. So yeah, this is an example of a partition. Now, the interesting thing here is we could arrive at this via an equivalence relation. So let me just explain what I mean here. It's actually congruence, mod 3, just on this set of 10 numbers. So which numbers are congruent mod 3?? Well, let's start with 1.. What are the things that are congruent mod 3 to 1? They're all the things that have a remainder of 1, mod 3.. 1,, 4, 7 and 10.. Now, 2 wasn't in that one. So let's look at the what's called congruence class containing 2.. All the things that are congruent mod 3 to 2. They are the things that have a remainder of 2 when you divide by 3.. So that's 2, 5 and 8.. And the other one is congruence mod 3. But these are the things congruent to 0.. Right, The three remainders are 0, 1 and 2.. 0 is not in the set, but these things are all congruent to 0, mod 3.. They're divisible by 3, in other words. So here's a nice easy way of getting a partition using the equivalence relation. We already decided it was an equivalence relation of congruence modulo, in this case 3.. So now that's quite nice. We've got this partition of these 10 elements and there was an equivalence relation that did it for us. So I'm just grouping things together in terms of the things that are equivalent to one another And that turns out to give us a partition. Well, that generalises. actually, There's a very close relationship between equivalence relations and partitions, And let me go through it. Well, there's really two directions to it. One is, if you start with an equivalence relation on a set, that will determine a partition, What I'm going to do is I'll pick any element of the set and I'll say: look at all the things that are equivalent to it, right, All the x's that are equivalent to a under this equivalence relation r. And I'm writing it that way there. So, of course, instead of ax in r, that's really saying a is related to x. And of course, because it's symmetric, I could just as well have written x is related to a. It doesn't matter, because it's an equivalence relation, so it's symmetric. So I can just say: all the things related to a, And I don't have to say which way round, because they're equivalent, They're the same. If it's one way, then it's the other automatically. Now, all these things here will form a little set within x of all the things that are equivalent to x, using the equivalence relation r, right? And it turns out that these subsets form a partition. So that means any equivalence relation you can use to split up the elements of a set into mutually disjoint patches whose union is the whole big set. So let me try and prove that What I really need to do is show that everything in x is in exactly one of the patches, right, Because that's the same thing, isn't it? So how will I go ahead and do that? Well, obviously, x is in the equivalence class in this cell. Let's call it the cell X- XR. Why is that? Because x is related to x, right? So every x is in one of the cells, namely the one defined by itself. Now you should notice that if you take the 1 to 10 one, let's see, Let's draw that one. So 1,, 4,, what was it? 7. And then we have 2,, 5,, 8.. Oh, and 10.. 10's in there too, isn't it? And then we have 3,, 6, 9 down there. So that's my partition of those 10 elements, based on congruence modulo 3.. Well, for example, if I pick, x equals 4,. well, what is? It's all the things that are related to 4.. It's going to be the things in this cell. That's what it is in this case And, by the way, that's the same as this: All the things related to 7.. It's also the same as this. It's also the same as this. You can use any of these four things, start from it and take all the things related to it. It doesn't make any difference. You get the same little subset. That's how equivalence relations work. They're really nice. On the other hand, if you look at this one, that's a completely different set. It's these three. They don't overlap at all. Of course, that can be written in two other different ways, using 5 and 8 as well, But anyway, certainly, if you pick any of the numbers from 1 to 10 in this example, like 6, well it's in this one Because 6 is related to itself. Now we also want to show that if we take two different cells, they don't have anything in common. Now to see this, let's first just notice something. Suppose x is in the cell determined by y, Then y, then y, x is in r, So x, y is in r. So, in particular, if a happens to be in the cell determined by x, then x, a is in r. Now x, a is in r, And we also have that y, x is in r. So overall, y a is in r. That's using transitivity right there. So a is in y r. given all these things that I've assumed here, If x is in y r and a is in x r, then a is in y r. So all of this is telling us the following: If you take anything in x r, then it's also in y r. So this little cell determined by x is a subset of the one determined by y. Now what were x and y again? And I'm just saying x is contained in the cell for y, And you can reverse it actually- And that's because x and y are related And so they must be equal. So anything in the cell, for example determined by 6, any of those can be used to define that cell. And we just saw that over here right with these four. And this just comes from having an equivalence relation. So anyway, that tells us that x is in exactly one of these cells. If it was in more than one, they would have to actually be the same right. So basically, if this x is in this cell, then its cell must equal that cell. They can't be just a small overlap, They have to be exactly the same cell. So different cells don't have any intersection. That's what that's showing. Now you don't have to worry too much about that proof. It's really what I've established here that you need to remember, which is that if you start with an equivalence relation, it determines a partition, a way of splitting all the elements up into patches that don't intersect. And for that reason, if we start with an equivalence relation, we call the cell containing A the equivalence class containing A. So the equivalence class here containing 7, is 1, 4, 7, 10.. And that's also the one containing. It's the equivalence class containing each of those four elements, in fact. Now the interesting thing is, how do we decide from this picture when two things are equivalent? We just look and see if they're in the same patch, if they're in the same equivalence class, because that's exactly what it means to be equivalent. A is related to B if, and only if, A and B are in the same equivalence class. So the information about the original equivalence relation is stored up in the partition. How do you decide when two things are equivalent, They're in the same cell partition class? For example, if you look at an equivalence class of well-formed formulas under logical equivalence, all you have to do is fix one formula, which is like fixing a truth table actually. Then you look at all the other well-formed formulas with the same truth table. That's the equivalence class of formulas that are equivalent to the one you started with. They all have the same truth table. You look at integers under congruence mod n, An equivalence class is all the ones having a particular remainder. So over here again, this is just the numbers one to ten, but it's the same basic idea: All the things with a remainder of two are equivalents, So they have the same remainder on division by two. So the equivalence class is all the things with that remainder. Now here it turns out it goes the other way around as well. So if you start with a partition- right, suppose you've got a set which is partitioned into pieces- then actually there is an equivalence relation that would have given you that partition in the first place. So what we'll do is we'll say that two elements are related if, and only if, they're in the same cell of the partition, the same patch. Now that turns out to define an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes will be the original cells that you started with. So it's really nice correspondence. And for this one, Well, I'll get you to look at a special case of this in the problems for next week, So that'll be on the problem sheet released on Friday. Well now these last two theorems really show that partitions and equivalence relations are basically the same things, just looked at in a different way. One is a binary relation, The other one is as a partition, But they really encode the same information about subsets of the set. So just to get you thinking about that, let's just look at a few little problems and get you to actually work through those. So let X equal Z12.. Now, what was Z12? again, It's all the remainders on division by 12.. 0,, 1,, 2, up to 11.. All right, So now. But I'm not going to view them as I'm not going to think about congruence mod 12.. Instead, I'm going to think about congruence mod 5.. So I'm really just taking this set of natural numbers and 0, a set of integers- here It just happens to be Z12. Define: A is related to B if, and only if, A is congruence to B, mod 5.. What's that mean? They have the same remainder on division by 5.. So this is very similar to the one I did with the numbers 1 to 10, and then I worked mod 3.. What is the partition into equivalence classes? So what are the equivalence classes? So you can take it as read that this is an equivalence relation. So then your job is to actually find out what the equivalence classes are. And just another one. So that's A, B. Let's just take some set of letters. There's no special structure to these elements at all. Partition: I'm going to partition it into three subsets: X1 is ABC, X2 is DE And X3,. well, there's only one thing left, isn't there F? Now that is a partition, isn't it? Into three subsets, because none of these overlap at all and everything's in at least one of those three. Well, it's exactly one. So this is a partition of X. What equivalence relation has these equivalence classes? Now, how do you actually go about defining an equivalence relation? It's a set of ordered pairs, So you can write it as a set of ordered pairs. That's the easiest way to specify what it is. Or you could say explicitly: you know which pairs of things are related by R, But writing as a set of ordered pairs is one way to do it. So, to get you started, it will definitely include an ordered pair like this. It's going to be reflexive, isn't it for a start? So you'll get all the ordered pairs that look like that, and then a bunch of other ones, And I'll just leave you to fill out the rest of that. So I'll just let you think about those for a bit and wander around see if anyone's got any questions. Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse, Maloreuse. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Every ordered pair that looks like that. so All of those are in there for a start. That's because of reflexivity. And what else is in there, though? Well, what's the criterion? again, Again, you look at whether two things are in the same cell, And so all the things in here, any two of them at a time, will be related to one another. So the other ones that come from this cell will be AB, BA- I have to say both, because it's a symmetric relation- And then BC, and then BC, but also AC and CA, So B is related to A, so B is related to A and A is related to C, etc. And then we also have these two things related in both possible orders, And then this one. well, there's nothing extra for it to be related to. we've already got F, comma F, so I think I've finished. now, Here we go. So there's obviously many different ways of partitioning that six-element set. There's even a formula online you can find for it. This is really: how many equivalence relations are there on that six-element set? Now, that's only Yeah, that's it. It's the whole thing. There's many different things. One example of an equivalence relation, by the way, would be to make everything equivalent to everything else. That does always give you an equivalence relation. So then you've just got one big cell that contains the whole thing. Not a very exciting equivalence relation. Another one is: you put everything in its own cell And that's really just equality. When are two things related? when they're equal, And I mentioned earlier, that's a special example of an equivalence relation. Otherwise, you can see what's happening is somehow we're saying A, B and C are somehow similar to one another, D and E are somehow similar to one another and F is just a bit of an outlier over there by itself. That's kind of what this equivalence relation is saying. Now, what about A? So here's the answer. How about A's answer? What's the partition? Well, we have to put all of those elements into one of- I guess it's going to be five- equivalence classes. Well, let's look at all the things that are congruent to zero, mod five, Right, Zero's in the set. So here's one of them. What else is in there? Well, zero's in there, isn't it? Because it's congruent to itself. mod five, I guess. five, Ten, All the things divisible by five within that set. All right, what about one? What are all the things related to one? They've got the same remainder on division by five as one does. Well, that's just one, isn't it? So what are the things that are congruent to one mod five in this set here? I guess probably just add one to these. One, six, eleven, They've all got a remainder of one on division by five. That's all it is. And then two, Two and seven, And there's no twelves there. That's it. I think Three, That'll be three and eight, Oh, anything else? I don't think. so. Yeah, there is one more, That's right. So it's fours, isn't it Four and nine, And then I could go ahead and look for five. but what's going to happen there? I'm just going to get this one back again, Because the things that relate to five are the things that are related to zero. That's how equivalence relations work. So this is back to this one, And in fact all the subsequent ones will just be one of the existing ones. This is already a partition, right here. One, two, three, four, five. They just correspond to the five remainders. So we can stop there. That doesn't really count. So there are the five cells in the partition. Okay, I'll put that up on Moodle. You'll get some more examples to think about coming up. Now I want to go on to something completely different, but still talking about binary relations, And that is what are called digraphs or directed graphs, which are ways of drawing them. At least, if you've got a small set, that you've got your binary relation on, this is a really convenient way of drawing a binary relation. You'll probably see quite a bit more of these in other papers. We can draw it or depict it using what's called a directed graph or, for short, a digraph. And what are these things? What we do is we make each element of the set that the binary relation is defined on what's called a vertex, So it's just a point in the drawing, maybe with a little circle indicating it, And then every ordered pair in the binary relation. so if X is related to Y, in other words, we'll draw an arrow between X and Y, from X to Y, So it has a direction to it, And we call them edges- for some reason That's the terminology that's used all the time- rather than arrows, but they really are arrows. And when we view a binary relation as a directed graph in this way, we'll call X, the vertex set, and R, which is all the ordered pairs, the edge set. Now sometimes you'll have X is related to X, right, And so that'll correspond to a loop. If you think about how you draw that, it's an arrow from X to itself. so you draw it as a loop and that's why we call them loops in general when you draw them. I'll give you an example of a drawing in a minute In fact, right now let's take a four-element set. It really works best with quite small sets. You can do it with any size set, really in principle. And let's suppose we've got this binary relation. This is not meant to be an equivalence relation or anything special, It's just a binary relation And obviously A is related to A, C is related to B, et cetera. So this is two ways of writing. You can write it as a set of ordered pairs or you could write it by saying which things are related, by spelling it out in this way down here, Both perfectly good ways of defining a binary relation. Set of the ordered pairs way is nice and clear. I think Here's the directed graph. Well, we should have a loop going from A to A, but then an edge or arrow going from C to B, one going from C to D and one going D to A. So here's one way to draw it. Pretty obvious what I've done. Obviously, the drawing depends entirely where you locate A, B, C, D in your picture. You'll get a different-looking drawing depending on how you draw it, how you put those points down, And they don't have to be exactly straight lines. Sometimes you put bends in them and so on. Obviously, with a loop you have to. So there is a loop in this one on the vertex A. But now we can actually relate the properties of reflexive, symmetric and transitive to properties of this directed graph, which is a nice thing to be able to do because it's good to turn things into pictures. So any relation on the set X is reflexive. What would that mean? Well, here we have A, A, and that gives us a loop. If it's reflexive, we'd also have B, B, C, C and D, D in there, wouldn't we? It's the definition of reflexive. So we'd have to have a loop on every vertex And that's the criterion. So the binary relation is reflexive if there's a loop on every vertex of its digraph. So when you draw it as a digraph, that must happen. What about symmetry? I guess symmetry means if there's an arrow going this way, then there's an arrow going back between the same two. Whenever there's an edge from A to B, there's an edge from B to A as well. If you had a symmetric digraph, you could perhaps rub those two out and replace it by a single edge that's got no arrows. Then you get a thing called a graph, an undirected graph, But we won't worry too much about that. You can do it though Transitive. that's kind of saying that if you've got an edge from A to B- So it's a picture a bit like this- You've got an edge from A to B, And then you know you've got an edge from B to C, Then you must have an edge that goes this way as well, And so obviously then, if you have an equivalence relation, all three of those things have to hold for the digraph. All right, so let's just put that to practice again straight away. I'll give you a few more things to think about in the last 10 minutes. Let's just take a simple four-element set, Something easy to draw. Define A, B is in R Or A is related to B. yes, No, not necessarily. Oh yeah, not necessarily. actually, It will reach everything in its equivalence class in one move, Yes, Or it won't be able to get there at all by any path. So you get these little lumps that are separate to one another. Yeah, that's right. That's what will happen in the directed graph of an equivalence relation. You'll get sort of lumps, components which are everything, can reach everything else within the lumps, but then the lumps can't contact each other at all. And that's what it means: to satisfy these three things, That's right, And there'll be a single link between any of them. So let me define this relation by saying this is not going to be an equivalence relation. actually Define: A, B are related if A divides B for any A, B in X, Remember. so, for example, two divides four And three divides three. But a lot of things don't divide one another. So first step is give R as a set of ordered pairs. Second thing: draw its digraph And then decide which of those three properties it has. Is it reflexive, Is it symmetric, Is it transitive? You can do that by any means. You can look at the picture and see if that looks right, or you can just try and figure it out some other way. So have a think about that for a few minutes and then I'll work through those. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. So N divides N for any N. But then what does one divide? Absolutely everything. So short and sweet: One, two, One, three. One, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight ordered pairs, as it happens. What's the theoretical limit of ordered pairs? What's the theoretical limit of ordered pairs we could have? I guess it's 16, is it Four times four? So it's about half of the possible things that could be related up. It is reflexive. It is reflexive. Oh, we should draw it, shouldn't we Two? So let me try and do that. One, two, three, four. Well, we're going to have a loop on every vertex. Well, we're going to have a loop on every vertex. That's reflexive. So I'll just note now that it's reflexive. Now what else have we got? One divides two, One divides, Actually, one divides everything. Two divides four. Now, we're just going to have to do that, And I guess I could put it right around the outside. But you're allowed to have crossings Sometimes. it's unavoidable And that's probably. it, isn't it? That's the directed graph in this case. I don't think I've missed anything. Is it symmetric? Very, very far from symmetric. We don't have any double edges, one going in each direction. It's what's called anti-symmetric, actually. But you'll see that when you get on the partial orders- It might even be in Friday's class- Not symmetric, And if you really wanted to be thorough about that part of the answer, you could substantiate it by saying, for example, two, four is in R, but four, two isn't, So there's a counterexample to it being symmetric. Is it transitive though? Well, let's see, We can go there there. Oh, and we can go there. It's actually a lot to check. It's quite a tricky thing to check transitivity. It turns out it is because this is what's called a partial order and they're always transitive. But it's not that easy to see, And actually one of the things coming up in the next lectures will be a way to test whether a binary relation is transitive. Transitive, That's just not obvious. You could give an argument, but it wouldn't relate directly to the digraph. There is a way to do it, but it's kind of hard to see, isn't it, whether it's transitive or not. OK, let's stop there And, like I say for the Friday class, it will be a recording. Thanks for coming.
